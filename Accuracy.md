[[Rules]]

All weapons have an Accuracy score that acts as a Limitfor that weapon. Accuracy scores reflect the quality andcraftsmanship of a weapon and determine the number ofhits that can be used in a skill test. Melee weapons, those that were made for combat,have an average Accuracy of 5. Improvised weapons—items that can be used, however awkwardly, to inflict damage but are not designed for combat, such as a golfclub or frying pan—usually have an accuracy of 4. Random objects used as weapons that are very unwieldy or heavy (like a chair, barstool, or refrigerator) generally have an Accuracy of 3. Standard Weapons that are in poor conditionor broken can have their Accuracy reduced by 1. Unarmed attacks use the Inherent Limit [Physical] as determined by the Attributes of the character and do not have an Accuracy rating. Items used as part of the Unarmed Attack, also use the Physical limit. Most basic ranged weapons have an accuracy of 4or 5. Specialized ranged weapons, like some sniper rifles,have an accuracy of 6 or higher. Improvised rangedweapons have an Accuracy of 3, and broken, old, damaged, or otherwise flawed ranged weapons can have their Accuracy reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1. This includes items that have been damaged through Matrix Combat.
