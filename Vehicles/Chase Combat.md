[[Vehicles]]

Definition: Two or more parties that are all in moving vehicles

Chase Combat Turn:
1) determine chase environment for this turn (Speed or Handling)
2) establish relative chase ranges
3) roll initiative
4) take actions in initiative order, drivers may perform chase actions or regular combat actions on their turn. Passengers may only perform regular combat actions

Chase Ranges
Distances between vehicles or groups is measured in chase ranges, a rough distance bracket.

Chase Environment
- Speed environment
	- long ranges, raw speed over handling
- Handling environment
	- quick reflexes and maneuverability
	- streets, foothills, crowded harbor, flying at street level.
	- Should influence modifiers for passenger actions

Chase Actions
All chase actions are complex actions
- Catch up/break away
	- number of range categories a vehicle can move is equal to the acceleration.
	- Drier makes a Reaction + Vehicle Skill [Speed or Handling] (maneuver Threshold) [[Vehicle Tests]]. For every hit they may shift one range category. If this would result in exceeding extreme range the pursuing vehicle can make the same test to try and stay in sight
- Cut off (short range)
	- Make an opposed Reaction + Vehicle Skill [Handling]. The target vehicle must make an immediate Vehicle Test or crash
- Ram [[Vehicle Combat]] (short range)
- Stunt (any range)
	- attempt a last second move or tight maneuver or jump
	- difficulty based on [[Vehicle Test Threshold Table.png]] and [[Vehicle Test and Terrain Modifiers.png]]
	- Roll Vehicle Skill + Reaction [Speed or Handling]. 
	- If the test if failed the vehicle goes out of control and could crash, slow down, etc based on gamemaster
	- If the test is successful the pursuers must make a vehicle test at the same threshold or fall behind one pursuit range

Passenger Actions
-2 on all attack rolls
- Attacks against Vehicles
	- driver rolls Reaction + Intuition as the defense part of the Opposed Test. Drones roll Pilot + Autosoft[Handling]
- Vehicle Damage
	- resists with Body + Armor (using trade in dice for hits, 4 for 1)
- Evasive Driving (Defense)
	- Vehicles that are under attack can use a free action and use evasive driving to lower initiative by 10 and add Intuition to defense pool when dodging attacks
- [[Called Shot]]
	- shot tires inflict a -2 dice pool per flat tire to vehicle tests
- Damage and Passengers
	- attacks must target either vehicle or passengers except when using ramming, suppressive fire, and AOE
	- If made against passengers, passengers are always considered to be in good cover (+3), but defending against an attack suffer a -2 to defense test, but get ot add the armor of the vehicle to any personal armor.
