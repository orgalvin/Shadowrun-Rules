[[Combat!]] [[Vehicles]]

In most cases, using any on-board vehicle accessories requires spending a complex action.

Movement Rates
The driver of the vehicle can adjust the movement rate with the required action during the Action Phase but chooses the movement rate at the beginning of each Combat Turn

Actions
Drivers must spend at least one Complex Action in each combat turn or  the vehicle is considered uncontrolled for the next turn (-2 dice pool for all actions for everyone in the vehicle). 
- The driver must make a [[Vehicle Tests]] or on the next Combat Turn something happens
	- 1) If the vehicle has a Pilot rating, the autopilot takes the Complex Action to drive the vehicle, and it begins driving with the flow of traffic
	- 2) If the autopilot is unable to take over, it travels along its current heading, with a decreasing speed over time

Free Actions
- Change Linked Device Mode
	- activate or deactivate various systems like sensors, ECM, weapons, and so on. Can also access status of vehicle (position, heading and speed, damage report, or current orders)

- Use sensors to detect or lock onto targets
- Use simple device to manually activate/deactivate sensors, ECM, weapon systems, and others.

Complex Actions
- Control vehicle
- Fire vehicle weapon
- make vehicle test (when executing maneuver)
- ramming

	- Vehicle Skill + Reaction to attack
	- Reaction + Intuition to defend if pedestian, or Reaction + Intuition [Handling] if driving another vehicle
	- make a damage resistance test, the base DV is determined by the ramming Body and speed. The Ramming Vheilce must resist only half that amount (rounded up). Characters resist with Body + Armor -6AP
