### Life with a comlink
- The comlink usually provides an AR overlay in your vision. It can be filled with advertisements about sales on items, or for that new trideo, or food, or navigation, warnings or official seals on local LEOs, anything that the internet can provide about your local area. This sort of overlay has replaced a lot of information in the real world, and things like physical menus have become a chic status symbol. The world is a bit dingy without the AR overlay
	- can use things like animated menus and logos etc in [[descriptions]]
	- If you have a direct neural interface (DNI) you can taste, smell, feel AR.
		- comes with trodes, implanted datajack, commlink, or cyberdeck that have a sim module.
