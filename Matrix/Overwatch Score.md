[[Matrix]]

As soon as a runner performs an Attack or [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]] action, the gamemaster starts tracking overwatch score. 

OS is increased by:
- number of hits a target gets on its defense test vs attack or [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]]
- every 15 minutes in the matrix it increases by 2d6 (rolled in secret)

When OS hits 40, the demiGOD finds you, hits you for 12 DV Matrix damage, resisted normally, then your marks are erased and you are dumped from the matrix, incurring [[Matrix Damage#Dumpshock and Link-Locking]]. Your current meatspace location is reported to the local authorities.

This works slightly differently in hosts
