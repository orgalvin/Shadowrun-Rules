[[The Will of the People/Rules/Matrix/Matrix]]

Every icon is one of 6 things:
- a persona - visual representation of a person jacked in, very flexible in avatar appearance
- a device - looks like a device, has some controls
- a PAN - a personal area network consisting of an individuals devices. Typically dangerous stuff like firearms are displayed distinctly
- a file - can look like a scroll, book, data pad, stone tablets, etc, whatever user flavors it to be
- a host
	- internally can be whatever the owner desires, indiana jones temple, lava world, beautiful forest, etc
- a mark - matrix authentication recognition key. Can look like anything identifying (tattoo, label, bracelet, etc.). Normally invisible except to those who placed them
	- For example, let’s say you’re using the icon of a neon green octopus. Your marks might look like neon green sucker marks. If you had a cowboy icon, your marks might look like cattle brands. If your icon were a vintage movie star, your marks might look like lipstick kisses.

Grids
- networks hosted by various entities
	- private grids such as those hosted by the Big 10 can be globally available but are also controlled by their hosts. Tend to be fancy and and a symbol of status if you have access
	- public grid is the barrens of the matrix, low resolution and slow
	- similar to a cell phone network in modern day
	- DemiGODs have overwatch over a grid, with their subfunction operatives known as G-men (basically matrix detectives/investigators)
	- Grid dictated by lifestyle unless you buy it separately
		- low and lower - public grid
		- middle - local grid
		- high - global grid from one of the big 10
		- luxury - any you want

TODO use info about host to flavor stuff for the CPUs etc, inside the CPU PAN, horrible twisted human hidden inside a pure sphere maybe, etc
