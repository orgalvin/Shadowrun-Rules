[[Matrix]]

##### Computer
The Computer skill represents your ability to use computers. Common functions for this skill include editing files, erasing marks, and searching the Matrix. It’s also used in your Matrix Perception Tests, which can be vital in finding that Black IC before it stomps your neural pathways.

##### Cybercombat
Cybercombat is the skill to use when you’re trying to wreck something or hurt someone in the Matrix. You can use it to damage electronics, break through defensive algorithms, and crash programs

##### Electronic Warfare
This skill is about controlling the airwaves, an important ability in a wireless world. It’s good for jamming other people’s signals with a jammer (or even your deck), hiding your own signature, and snooping on other people’s datastreams.

##### Hacking
Hacking is about cleverly convincing the Matrix to do things it’s not designed to do. It lets you find and exploit weaknesses in digital defenses, and otherwise use finesse in your Matrix mayhem.

##### Hardware
Hardware describes your ability to build, repair and manipulate electronic hardware. This skill is rarely used in the Matrix, but it encompasses everything that runs on the Matrix—and everything the Matrix runs on. It’s very useful for fixing electronics that have been damaged by Matrix combat, not to mention upgrading your deck or building your own devices.

##### Software
This skill is about creating programs and other code that runs in the Matrix. It’s good for writing your own programs and analyzing strange code. If you’ve got the guts to try to handle a data bomb, you’ll need some solid Software skills to keep it from going off in your face

##### Resonance
The skills in the Resonance Skill Group are only usable by technomancers.
