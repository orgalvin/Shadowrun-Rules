[[Matrix]]

##### Devices
Devices have a device rating, and Data Processing and Firewall (typically equal to the device rating)

By default, a device’s icon looks like the object it represents, in miniature if the real thing is larger than a person. It has controls of some kind, often the same controls it has in meat space, but not necessarily.

##### Personas
Personas are the “people” of the Matrix. Some personas are actually people, users and hackers who are connected to and using the Matrix. When a person uses a device to connect to the Matrix, the device’s icon is subsumed by the persona’s icon, so it’s basically gone from the Matrix until the persona jacks out. You can only run one persona at a time; switching requires you to reboot both the device you’re currently on and the device to which you want to shift your persona.

Some personas are [[Matrix#agent|agents]], performing tasks on behalf of their owners. [[Matrix#agent|Agents]] running alone on a device replace the device icon the same way a living user does. If you’re running an [[Matrix#agent|agent]] along with your persona, it appears with its own separate persona, even though you’re using the same device. 

Each [[Hosts#IC|IC]] program has its own persona. [[Hosts#IC|IC]] programs are not connected to devices because they’re only found in hosts (thankfully). 

Technomancers have a living persona not attached to any device. A technomancer’s persona exists in the Matrix as long as they’re awake, unless they deliberately jack out. When a technomancer compiles a sprite, the sprite has its own persona, too.
