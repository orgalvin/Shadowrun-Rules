[[Matrix]]

You cannot run more than one program of the same type on your deck. They appear as icons connected to your persona in the matrix, with its appearance being tied to its function, looking like tools, clothing, etc

Program Listings
- common programs are harmless and available most anywhere
- hacking programs are more dangerous and illegal to buy, own, or use without a license
- Agents are autonomous programs with a rating of 1-6
	- Occupy a program slot
	- Use [[Matrix Attributes]] from the device they are on and their rating for attributes. They also have Computer, Hacking, and Cybercombat sklls at a rating equal to their own
	- can use programs on the same device they are on
	- Has its own persona and icon and is about as smart as a [[Pilot Program]] of the same rating
	- Any attack on an agent damages the device on whcih they are running rather than the agent itself. This means that you and your agents share the same Matrix Condition Monitor

#### Common Programs
 Browse: This handy browser and search engine cuts the time for a Matrix Search action in half.

Configurator: When you run this program, choose a configuration for your deck other than its current one. This alternate configuration is stored in the Configurator program. The next time you reconfigure your deck, you may switch to the full configuration stored in this program instead of just swapping two attributes or programs, even if it means Configurator stops running at that point. The configuration stored in this program doesn’t change when you use it, so you can recall it again if you recon- figure your deck to something else (assuming the Con- figurator program is running when you want to recall the stored information).

Edit: This program makes editing easier with a smart interface that learns your style and can even give you suggestions. Add 2 to the Data Processing limit for any Edit tests made while this is running.

Encryption: Activating the Encryption utility gives you a +1 bonus to your Firewall attribute.

Signal Scrub: By analyzing the background noise and incoming signals, Signal Scrub gives you Rating 2 noise reduction.

Toolbox: The memory management utilities in the Toolbox give you a +1 bonus to your Data Processing attribute.

Virtual Machine: This program creates a virtual memory space in your deck, giving you increased pro- gram capacity at the cost of system stability. Your deck can run two additional programs, but whenever your persona takes Matrix damage, it takes an additional box of Matrix damage that cannot be resisted.

#### Hacking Programs
 Armor: This program works with your firmware as a second firewall, giving you a +2 dice pool modifier to resist Matrix damage.

Baby Monitor: The Baby Monitor program uses al- gorithms stolen from the Grid Overwatch Division and keeps track of your movements in the Matrix, so you always know your current Overwatch Score.

Biofeedback: When you’re attacked, this program laces all of the attacks you make against other icons with dangerous biofeedback signals, the sort of drek that Black IC and G-men use. This program only works if the target is biological in nature (a security spider, for instance). When your attack causes Matrix damage, the target is hit with an equal amount of Stun (if the target is using cold-sim) or Physical (if the target is using hot-sim) biofeedback damage. This program also applies to dam- age caused by failed Attack actions against you. Bio- feedback damage is resisted with Willpower + Firewall.

Biofeedback Filter: This program is like a firewall for your sim module, giving you a +2 dice pool modifier to resist biofeedback damage.

Blackout: This is a kinder version of Biofeedback. It works the same way, but only causes Stun damage, even if the target is using hot-sim.

Decryption: The code-cutting algorithms in this pro- gram give you a +1 bonus to your Attack attribute.

Defuse: This program creates predictive barriers be- tween you and a Data Bomb, giving you a +4 dice pool modifier to resist damage from one.

Demolition: Demolition comes with the latest and most effective Data Bomb-coding techniques, adding 1 to the rating of any Data Bomb you set while this is running.

Exploit: This program analyzes and scans a target for weaknesses in its Firewall. You receive a +2 bonus to your [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]] attribute when attempting a Hack on the Fly action.

Fork: You can perform a single Matrix action on two targets with this program. You make a single test, with modifiers from each target both counting toward your dice pool. Each of the targets defend with their own dice pools. Determine the result of the actions separately against each target.

Guard: This program keeps an eye out for weakness- es the same way an attacker would, reducing the extra damage you take from marks by 1 DV per mark.

Hammer: Whenever you cause Matrix damage with an action, this offensive program lets you inflict +2 DV worth of Matrix Damage. This does not apply against targets that take damage from failing an Attack action against you.

Lockdown: When you cause damage to a persona, he or she is link-locked until you stop running this pro- gram or they successfully Jack Out.

Mugger: By actively tracking your marks, the bonus damage from them is increased by 1 DV per mark.

Shell: This program uses a set of filtering algorithms to give you a +1 dice pool modifier to resist both Matrix and biofeedback damage. This modifier stacks with sim- ilar modifiers from other programs.

Sneak: This utility bounces your Matrix traffic through unnecessary routes, giving you a +2 dice pool modifier to defend against Trace User actions. Addi- tionally, if a demiGOD converges on you while this pro- gram is running, they don’t get your physical location, although you’re still hit with all the other bad stuff they throw at you.

Stealth: This clever program gives you a +1 bonus to your [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]] attribute.

Track: The Track program keeps an eye on your tar- gets for you, making it easier to find their meat world equivalents. Add 2 to your Data Processing attribute when making Trace User tests with Track running. Al- ternately, if the target is running Sneak, Track negates the +2 dice pool bonus from that program. Note that the program delivers one of the listed benefits, not both.

Wrapper: This program overrides the Matrix’s proto- cols for icons. While this program is running, your icons can be anything you want them to be when you use the Change Icon action. From the lens of the Matrix, your Hammer program could look like a music file, your Ares Predator icon could look like a credstick, and your own persona could look like a Mitsubishi Nightsky. Another persona can see what the disguised icon really is with a Matrix Perception Test, but they need to at least suspect enough to check (Matrix Perception, p. 241).
