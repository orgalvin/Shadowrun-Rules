##### BRUTE FORCE (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: none 
Test: Cybercombat + Logic [Attack] v. Willpower + Firewall 
You can use this action to mark a target without obtaining the normal permissions you need. This is the action for hackers emphasizing their Attack over their [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]], making it related to [[#HACK ON THE FLY COMPLEX ACTION|Hack on the Fly]]. If you succeed in this action, you place one [[mark]] on it. You can have up to a maximum of three [[mark|marks]] per icon. If you wish, you may also inflict 1 DV of [[Matrix damage]] to the target for every two full net hits, if the target can take [[Matrix damage]], which is resisted with the target’s Device Rating + Firewall. Before rolling, you can declare that you are trying to place more than one [[mark]]. If you try for two [[mark|marks]] in one shot, you take a –4 dice pool penalty on the attempt. If you try for three [[mark|marks]] in a single swipe, you take a –10 dice pool penalty. You can also use this action to hop to a grid for which you don’t have legitimate access. The defense dice pool in this case is 4 dice for a local grid or 6 dice for a global grid. If you succeed, instead of putting a [[mark]] on the grid, you hop to that grid immediately. Using Brute Force to hop grids successfully doesn’t alert the grid or its demiGOD the way most successful Attack actions do. 

##### CHANGE ICON (SIMPLE ACTION)
Marks Required: Owner 
Test: none (Data Processing action) 
You change the target’s icon to one that you have a copy of or have designed yourself. Changing an icon doesn’t change the results of a Matrix Perception action, but might fool personas who don’t take the time to inspect your new look. You can target your own icon, if you like. 

##### CHECK OVERWATCH SCORE (SIMPLE ACTION)
Marks Required: none 
Test: Electronic Warfare + Logic [Sleaze] v. 6 dice 
You find out how close the grid is to converging on you. Checking the OS is a [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]] action, so the defense against it will add to your OS. If you succeed, the gamemaster tells you what your OS was when you started the action, then adds the hits from the defending dice pool. 

##### CONTROL DEVICE (VARIABLE ACTION) 
Marks Required: varies 
Test: (as action) [Data Processing (or special)] v. (as action) or Electronic Warfare + Intuition [Sleaze] v. Intuition + Firewall 
You perform an action through a device you control (or at least control sufficiently), using your commlink or deck like a remote control or video-game controller. The dice pool of any test you make using this action uses the rating of the appropriate skill and attribute you would use if you were performing the action normally. For example, firing a drone-mounted weapon at a target requires a Gunnery + Agility test, and using a remote underwater welder calls for a Nautical Mechanic + Logic test. All actions you take while controlling a device use either the normal limit for that action or your Data Processing rating, whichever is lower. If there is no test associated with the action you want the device to perform (such as unlocking a maglock or ejecting a clip from a pistol), you must succeed in an Electronic Warfare + Intuition [Sleaze] v. Intuition + Firewall test to perform the action. You can use this action to control multiple devices at once. If you are the owner of all devices being commanded and they are all being commanded to do exactly the same thing, taking this action costs nothing extra. Otherwise, you must split your dice pool into a number of groups equal to the number of devices you want to control with a single action. The type of action this is (i.e., Free, Simple, Standard, and Complex) is the same as the type of action attempted with the device, and it requires 1 mark for Free Actions, 2 marks for Simple Actions, and 3 marks for Standard or Complex Actions. This action is a [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]] action whenever you use your [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]] as a limit in the test, which incurs the same risk of Overwatch Score and consequences of failure as all [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]] actions. 

##### CRACK FILE (COMPLEX ACTION) 
Marks Required: 1 
Test: Hacking + Logic [Attack] v. Protection Rating x 2 
You remove the protection from a file, making it readable. This action doesn’t need to be performed on a file that isn’t protected, of course. 

##### CRASH PROGRAM (COMPLEX ACTION) 
Marks Required: 1 
Test: Cybercombat + Logic [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall 
You overload part of your target’s memory and scramble one of its running programs. You need to specify which program you’re trying to crash; you can learn what your target is running either with a [[Matrix Perception]] action or by observing the program in action. If you succeed, the program is scrambled: it ends and cannot be restarted until the device it was running on is rebooted.

##### DATA SPIKE (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: none 
Test: Cybercombat + Logic [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall 
You send harmful instructions to a persona or device, causing Matrix damage to the target. Your attack has a Damage Value equal to your Attack rating, with one additional box of damage per net hit, and two additional boxes of damage for each mark you have on the target. This damage is [[Matrix damage]] (p. 228), resisted with the target’s Device Rating + Firewall. 

##### DISARM DATA BOMB (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: none 
Test: Software + Intuition [Firewall] v. Data Bomb Rating x 2 
You attempt to disarm a [[#SET DATA BOMB COMPLEX ACTION|Data Bomb]] that you have detected (usually as the result of a [[Matrix Perception]] action). If you score any net hits, the Data Bomb is removed and deleted. If not, the Data Bomb activates, causing its damage and possibly destroying any file to which it was attached (assuming it was set to destroy the file). 

##### EDIT FILE (COMPLEX ACTION) 
Marks Required: 1 
Test: Computer + Logic [Data Processing] v. Intuition + Firewall 
Edit File allows you to create, change, copy, delete, or protect any kind of file. The defender against this test is either the host holding the file or the owner of the file (if it’s not on a host). Each action is enough to alter one detail of a file—a short paragraph of text, a single detail of an image, or two or three seconds of video or audio (you and your gamemaster can work out what exactly “one detail” means). Your gamemaster may impose penalties on the test if your edit is particularly intricate or tricky. If you want to perform a continuous edit, such as removing your teammates from a video feed, you need to perform this action once per Combat Turn for as long as you want to keep the edit going. If you use this action to copy a file, you are the new file’s owner. If the file you want to copy has protection on it, this action automatically fails. If the file has a Data Bomb, the Data Bomb goes off on you (so try to remember to scan files before you open them). You can also use this action to set protection on a file if you’re its owner. To protect a file, make a Simple Computer + Logic [Data Processing] test. The number of hits you get becomes the rating of the protected file. A protected file cannot be read, changed, deleted, or copied until its protection is broken. 

##### ENTER/EXIT HOST (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: 1 
Test: n/a 
You enter a host that you have a mark on and your icon appears there, or you leave a host you’re already in. There is no test for this action: a host allows anyone to enter if they’ve got a mark, and anyone inside can exit. The host might not be so welcoming once you’re inside, of course, and some IC has the ability to keep you trapped in a host until you can break out. When you leave a host, you return to the grid from which you entered. 

##### ERASE MARK (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: special 
Test: Computer + Logic [Attack] v. Willpower + Firewall 
You eradicate a mark that has been placed on your persona or on another icon. To perform this action, you need three marks on the icon from which you are erasing a mark. You do not, however, need a mark on the icon that placed the mark in the first place. You can try to erase two marks in the same action at a –4 dice pool penalty, and three marks in one go at a –10 dice pool penalty; if you go for more than one mark, all of the marks must be on the same icon and from the same icon. You can’t use this action to change the target’s owner. For example, an IC program has marked both you and your buddy. You roll your Computer + Logic (with your Attack program rating as the limit), opposed by the IC’s rating (standing in for Willpower) + Firewall to erase its mark on your icon. You need three marks on your buddy’s icon to erase the IC’s marks on him, but he isn’t the sharing type, so he’s on his own for now. 

##### ERASE MATRIX SIGNATURE (COMPLEX ACTION) 
Marks Required: none 
Test: Computer + Resonance [Attack] v. (Signature Rating) x 2 You eradicate a Matrix signature that has been left by a Resonance being, such as a technomancer or a sprite. If successful, the signature dissipates. You need to have a Resonance rating to attempt this action; unlike other actions that need Resonance, this one’s a real Matrix Action, and an Attack one to boot, so you risk Matrix damage and Overwatch Score when you use it. 

##### FORMAT DEVICE (COMPLEX ACTION) 
Marks Required: 3 
Test: Computer + Logic [Sleaze] v. Willpower + Firewall
You rewrite the boot code for the device. The next time it would reboot, it instead shuts down for good, or until its software can be replaced (an Extended Software + Logic [Mental] (12, 1 hour) Test). A device that has been shut down in this fashion loses all of its wireless modifiers but can still be used as a normal mechanism (a door with a manual handle can be opened, a gun with a trigger can be fired, etc.) and cannot be accessed from the Matrix.

##### FULL MATRIX DEFENSE (INTERRUPT ACTION) 
Marks Required: Owner
Test: none (Firewall action) 
This allows you to defend against Attack actions, and may be taken at any time. Whenever you make a defense test against a Matrix Action, add your Willpower to the dice pool (or add it again if it’s already in there). When you take this action, your Initiative Score is reduced by 10, but the effects last for the rest of the Combat Turn. 

##### GRID HOP (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: none
Test: none (Data Processing action) 
You hop to another grid—for example, you might jump from the public grid to Seattle’s Emerald City local grid. To do this, you must have access to your destination grid. If you do not have access, you can use Brute Force or Hack on the Fly to hop to another grid illegally. If you’re inside a host, you need to leave the host before you can hop to another grid. 

##### HACK ON THE FLY (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: none
Test: Hacking + Logic [Sleaze] v. Intuition + Firewall 
You can use this action to mark a target without getting the normal permissions. This is the action for hackers emphasizing their [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]] over their Attack, making it an analog to Brute Force. When targeting an icon, you put one mark on it, up to a maximum of three marks per icon. Additionally, every two full net hits counts as one hit on a Matrix Perception Test, so you can get some info along with your mark. Before rolling, you can declare that you are trying for more than one mark. If you try for two marks in one shot, you take a –4 dice pool penalty on the attempt. If you try for three marks in one go, you take a –10 dice pool penalty. You can also use this action to hop to a grid for which you don’t have legitimate access. The defense dice pool in this case is 4 dice for a local grid or 6 dice for a global grid. If you succeed, instead of putting a mark on the grid, you hop to that grid immediately. Using  [[#HACK ON THE FLY COMPLEX ACTION|Hack on the Fly]] to hop grids unsuccessfully doesn’t alert the grid or its demiGOD the way most unsuccessful [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]] actions do. 

##### HIDE (COMPLEX ACTION) 
Marks Required: 0 
Test: Electronic Warfare + Intuition [Sleaze] v. Intuition + Data Processing You’ll probably be spotted by another icon, even if you’re running silent. You can use this action to make a target lose you. If you succeed, the target stops spotting you and needs to perform a new Matrix Perception action against you if it wants to find you again. You can’t hide from an icon that has a mark on you, so you’ll need to clear those before you can try this action. 

##### INVITE MARK (SIMPLE ACTION)
Marks Required: Owner
Test: none (Data Processing action) 
If you’re the owner of a device, file, persona, host, or IC program, you can offer other icons the opportunity to put a mark on your device, file, etc. When you make the offer, you choose the number of marks allowed, their duration, and how long the offer stands. The invitee can then mark your icon with a Free Action. You may revoke your offer at any time before the mark is placed, but once another icon has a mark, you need to either use the Erase Mark action or reboot your device to remove it before the duration you chose expires. 

##### JACK OUT (SIMPLE ACTION)
Marks Required: Owner 
Test: Hardware + Willpower [Firewall] v. Logic + Attack
This jacks you out of the Matrix and reboots the device you are using. You suffer dumpshock if you were in VR. The defense pool only applies if you’ve been linklocked (p. 229) by someone; the test is against the icon that locked your link. If more than one persona has you link-locked, you need to beat each of them individually: use a single roll and compare your hits to rolls from each opponent who had established a link-lock. You can only jack out yourself. You can’t dump other people except by beating them into submission through Matrix damage. 

##### JAM SIGNALS (COMPLEX ACTION) 
Marks Required: Owner 
Test: Electronic Warfare + Logic [Attack] 
This action turns the wireless device you are using into a local jammer. As long as you do not use the device for any further Matrix actions, the device adds any hits you get on the test to the noise rating for all Matrix actions conducted by or targeting any devices within 100 meters. If you want selective jamming or directional jamming, buy a jammer—that’s what they’re for.

##### JUMP INTO RIGGED DEVICE (COMPLEX ACTION) 
Marks Required: 3 
Test: Electronic Warfare + Logic [Data Processing] v. Willpower + Firewall
You jump into a device that has a rigger adaptation, usually a vehicle or a drone. There’s a list of things you need to have in order to jump into a device: you have to have three marks on the device you want to jump into, you have to be in VR, the device you want to jump into has to have a rigger adaptation, and you have to have a control rig. If you are the device’s owner, or the device’s owner has given you permission to jump into the device, you don’t need to make a test. In the Matrix, the icon of the device you jumped into becomes part of your persona. If someone else is already jumped into the device, you cannot attempt this action until he or she vacates. 

##### MATRIX PERCEPTION (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: none
Test: Computer + Intuition [Data Processing] (v. Logic + [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]])
This versatile and important action is used both for finding icons in the Matrix and for analyzing Matrix objects. When you use this action to analyze a Matrix object or scan the vicinity for silent-running icons, you make a Simple Test and your hits determine how much info you get. For each net hit scored, you can ask for one piece of information about the object—this could be type, a rating, how many marks it has on it, any files it may be carrying, which grid it is using, whether any silent running icons are in the area, or any other pertinent Matrix information. You learn one fact per net hit. If you get a list of marks, you can only recognize marks you have seen before or marks left by personas that you have marks on yourself. Otherwise you only get a count. If you’re trying to spot an icon that is farther than 100 meters away, this is a Simple Test: the first hit lets you spot the target, and any additional hits can be used to get more information about it as mentioned above. If you’re looking for an icon that is running silent (after you’ve determined that it’s present), the test becomes an Opposed Test, with the target defending with Logic + [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]]. Net hits are used just like you would for spotting distant targets, with the first one for spotting the target and the rest for analysis. 

##### MATRIX SEARCH (SPECIAL ACTION)
Action: special Marks Required: n/a
Test: Simple Computer + Intuition [Data Processing]
You search the Matrix for information about a topic. The time it takes and the threshold of the test depend on the general availability of the information in question and the area being searched, respectively. Any hits above and beyond the threshold can be used to reduce the search time. Divide the base time by the net hits to determine the reduction. If you fail this test, you still spend the full base time looking. Some information is protected and kept secret, stored in a host that is not publicly accessible. Finding this information usually requires you to find and enter the hosts in which the data is hidden. You can then make a Matrix Search within the host, using a base time of 1 minute (regardless of the kind of information you’re looking for). This only works if the information is at least occasionally accessed by the legitimate users of the host. If the information is archived, you’ll need to dig deeper into the host for that information, a dangerous process that is detailed in the forthcoming Matrix sourcebook. 

##### REBOOT DEVICE (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: 3 
Test: Computer + Logic [Data Processing] v. Willpower + Firewall 
The device on which this action is performed shuts down and immediately reboots. The device comes back online at the end of the following Combat Turn. The device ceases electronic functions and disappears from the Matrix until its reboot time is over. When you reboot the device your persona is on, your OS is reset to zero and all of your marks, as well as the ones others may have put on your icon, are erased. If you’re in VR when you reboot, you suffer from dumpshock (see p. 229). When you come back online, your icon can be on any grid to which you have legitimate access, or the public grid if you have no other grid access. When you perform this action, you can choose a delay of any amount of time between the time the device shuts down and the time it comes back online. Anyone with physical access to the device can override this delay by hitting the power button, which starts the boot process and brings the device online at the end of the following Combat Turn. This action only works on devices. It doesn’t work on hosts, living beings (like technomancers, although they can “reboot” themselves, p. 251), or Resonance constructs (like sprites), and the only persona it works on is your own. If you’re the owner of the device you’re rebooting, you don’t have to make a test. You can’t use this action on a device that is link-locked (p. 229). 

##### SEND MESSAGE (SIMPLE ACTION)
Marks Required: n/a (or 1)
Test: none (Data Processing action) 
You send a text or audio message the length of a short sentence, an image, or a file via the Matrix to a user whose commcode you have. If you’re using the Matrix through a DNI, even if you’re in AR, you can send longer and more complicated messages, about a paragraph worth of text. You can also use this action to open a live feed to one or more recipients, using any digital recording devices you have. 

##### SET DATA BOMB (COMPLEX ACTION) 
Marks Required: 1 
Test: Software + Logic [Sleaze] v. (Device Rating x 2)
You set a Data Bomb in a file. When you do, choose the rating of the Data Bomb, up to the net hits on your test. You also need to choose whether or not the Data Bomb will delete the file to which it is attached when activated, and you need to program the passcode required to deactivate it. A file can only have one Data Bomb on it at a time. The Data Bomb is triggered when someone attempts to read, edit, copy, protect, delete, or put another Data Bomb on the file without using the already-in-place Data Bomb’s passcode. When a Data Bomb goes off, it causes (Rating)D6 Matrix Damage (resisted normally) to the icon that tripped it, deletes the file (if it was set that way), and then is itself deleted. If the passcode is used, the Data Bomb doesn’t activate. Instead, it remains attached to the file, waiting for the next guy. A Data Bomb can be detected using Matrix Perception. If it’s detected, it can be defused with the Disarm Data Bomb action; a disarmed Data Bomb is deleted. Damn. 

##### SNOOP (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: 1
Test: Electronic Warfare + Intuition [Sleaze] v. Logic + Firewall
This action lets you intercept Matrix traffic sent to and from your target for as long as you have the target marked. You can listen to, view, or read this data live, or you can save it for later playback/viewing if you have something to store it on (your deck will do). 

##### SPOOF COMMAND (COMPLEX ACTION) 
Marks Required: 1 (see description) 
Test: Hacking + Intuition [Sleaze] v. Logic + Firewall 
You spoof a device’s owner’s identity, making the device think that your command is a legitimate one from its owner. You need one mark on the icon you are imitating; you do not need a mark on the target. The opposing dice roll is still based on the target, though. This trick only works on devices and agents, not IC, sprites, hosts, personas, or any other icons. 

##### SWITCH INTERFACE MODE (SIMPLE ACTION)
Marks Required: Owner
Test: none (Data Processing action) 
You switch your perception from AR to VR or vice versa. Switching to VR causes your body to go limp, so don’t do it somewhere dangerous. If you switch from VR to AR, you lose the bonus Initiative Dice from VR (Changing Initiative, p. 160). If you’re link-locked (p. 229), you cannot switch interface modes. You can only do this to yourself; you can’t switch other people’s interface mode. 

##### TRACE ICON (COMPLEX ACTION)
Marks Required: 2
Test: Computer + Intuition [Data Processing] v. Willpower + [[Matrix Attributes#Sleaze|Sleaze]] 
You find the physical location of a device or persona in the Matrix. After succeeding with this action, you know the target’s location for as long as you have at least one mark on the target. This doesn’t work on hosts because they generally have no physical location, or IC programs because they are confined to their hosts.
