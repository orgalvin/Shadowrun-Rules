 Below you, stretching off in every direction, three-di- mensional icons of real-world devices light up the land- scape like a galaxy of stars in a perfect night sky. The devices that appear to be closest to you are the ones nearest your meat body. Your own icon—your virtual self— is usually the brightest and clearest of the icons. The points of light on the distant horizon, the devic- es that are the farthest from your presence in the real world, flicker and sputter with the lag of data traveling from the other side of the globe.

Hovering above you, massive hosts—tremendous data collections guarded by spiders and IC—float like corporate gods, attempting to see everything and be surprised by nothing. Their custom geometries form a virtual geography that is unconnected to the meat- bound map below. The larger ones, the size of cities, be- long to the Big Ten megacorporations and are dangerous to enter if you’re not invited. Other, smaller hosts cluster in the neural sky, offering social connections, presenting consumer products, or promising darker pleasures.

Between it all are the representations of people, pro- cesses, programs, and data that zip from icon to icon and host to host, leaving datatrails of light that fade back into the dim hum of information. The Matrix moves at the speed of light and thought.

# Jargon
 #### agent
 A semi-autonomous program that is capable of taking independent action in the Matrix.

#### archive
An area of a host that stores files securely away from all users, legitimate or otherwise.

#### AI
AKA: artificial intelligence. Self–aware and self–sustaining intelligent programs that evolved within the Matrix.

#### AR
AKA: augmented reality. Information added to or overlaid upon a user’s normal sensory perceptions in the form of visual data, graphics, sounds, haptics, smell, and/or limited simsense.

#### ARO
AKA: augmented reality object. Virtual representations (usually visual graphics, but other sensory data can be included, typically sound) that are connected to a physical object or location in the physical world and viewable through augmented reality. The abbreviation, ARO, is pronounced “arrow.”

####  avatar
The icon of a persona.  

#### BTL 
AKA: better–than–life, beetle. Hyper–real levels of simsense that are addictive and potentially dangerous.

#### brick
To destroy a device by Matrix damage; also, a device destroyed in that fashion.

#### cold-sim
Standard simsense that operates at legal, safe levels. Used by most people to access virtual reality.

#### commcode
Combination email address, phone number, and IM name that identifies an individual for communications; if people want to get a hold of you, this is what they need.

#### commlink
AKA: link. The handheld or worn personal computer used by nearly everyone to access wireless services.

#### complex form
Mental algorithms that technomancers use to manipulate the Matrix—their equivalent of programs.

#### control rig
An implanted augmentation that allows a rigger to “jump” into a vehicle, drone, or other device, giving him or her superior control and performance.

#### deck
A tablet-sized computer used to hack the Matrix; it is restricted or illegal in most of the civilized world.

#### demiGOD
A subsection of the Grid Overwatch Division that oversees a single grid, run by the grid’s owner.

#### device
A piece of gear that performs functions integral to a network. See also [[Devices and Personas#Devices]]

#### DNI
AKA: direct neural interface. A connection between the brain’s neural impulses and a computer system that allows a user to mentally interact with that system.

#### drone
An unmanned vehicle that can be controlled via direct wireless link or through the Matrix.

#### echo
An enhanced ability a technomancer can learn after undergoing submersion.

#### fading
Mental drain technomancers sometimes experience when using their abilities.

#### file
A program or set of data that is collected as a single package; this runs the gamut from annual reports and kitten videos to autosofts and Attack programs.

#### firewall
A program that guards a node from intrusion. This is the first line of defense of a device or host to fend off unwanted Matrix interference.

#### geo-tagging
Assigning [[Matrix#augmented reality object ARO|AROs]] to a specific physical location, often using [[Matrix#radio frequency identification tag RFID pronounced “arfid” A device no bigger than a matchbox that holds data and other miniaturized electronics|RFID]] tags.

#### ghost in the machine
Mysterious phenomena and perceived entities that exist entirely within the Matrix. Some believe these are AIs or magical spirits of the Matrix. Others believe they are the disembodied personalities of people trapped within the Matrix during and since the Crash of ‘64.

#### GOD
AKA: Grid Overwatch Division. An entity run by the Corporate Court to oversee security in the Matrix.

#### grid
The resources offered by a Matrix provider; typically, you can access information on that provider’s grid easily, while accessing info on other grids is more difficult. The term is also used to refer to the Matrix as a whole outside any host.

#### hacker
Someone who explores and exploits the Matrix.

#### haptics
Computer interactions based on the sense of touch.

#### host
A self-contained place in the Matrix. Hosts have no physical location, as they exist purely in the Matrix cloud.

#### hot-sim
Simsense without the safeguards that prevent potentially damaging biofeedback. Hot-sim is illegal in the civilized world.

#### icon
The virtual representation of a device, persona, file, or host in the Matrix.

#### IC
AKA: intrusion countermeasures.Software that runs in a host and protects that host from unauthorized users. The abbreviation, IC, is pronounced “ice.”

#### jackpoint
Any physical location that provides access to the Matrix through plugging in with a wired connection.

#### living persona
The mental “organic software” that allows technomancers to access the Matrix with only their minds.

#### master
A device, usually a commlink, cyberdeck, or host, that is linked to other devices in order to protect them against Matrix attacks.

#### Mark
AKA Matrix authentication recognition key. A token that measures a user’s access to a device, host, or persona.

#### Matrix object
A persona, file, device, mark, or host in the Matrix.

#### Matrix
The worldwide telecommunications network and everyone and everything connected to and by that network.

#### meat

#### meshed
(slang) Online, connected to the Matrix.

#### noise
Unwanted data or wireless signals that make using the Matrix slower or more difficult. (slang) Unwelcome information.

#### persona
A user, agent, or other autonomous or semi-autonomous icon in the Matrix. See also [[Devices and Personas#Personas]]
