[[Matrix]]

There are 3 ways to mark an icon:
- Legally invited to add one
- [[Matrix Actions#BRUTE FORCE COMPLEX ACTION|Brute Force]]
- [[Matrix Actions#HACK ON THE FLY COMPLEX ACTION|Hack on the Fly]]

Marks can make it easy for device owners, like Corps, to track down their property unless the marks are removed. You can illegally change an owner and remove those marks with a Hardware toolkit and an Extended [[Matrix Skills#Hardware]] + [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG]] [Mental] (24, 1 hour) test.
- a glitch will notify the athorities

Changing ownership of a file is easier, using [[Matrix Actions#EDIT FILE COMPLEX ACTION|Edit File]] to copy it, then deleting (if you wish) the original file
