There are 3 ways to mark an icon:
- Legally invited to add one
- Brute Force
- Hack on the Fly

Marks can make it easy for device owners, like Corps, to track down their property unless the marks are removed. You can illegally change an owner and remove those marks with a Hardware toolkit and an Extended [[Matrix Skills#Hardware]] + [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG]] [Mental] (24, 1 hour) test.
- a glitch will notify the athorities
