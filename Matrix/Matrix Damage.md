[[Matrix]]

##### Matrix Condition Monitor
- 8 + (Device Rating / 2) boxes
- Damage is always resisted by Device Rating + [[Matrix Attributes#Firewall]]
- There is no penalty for matrix damage analogous to wounded
- If the monitor is completely filled the device is bricked
	- If you are in VR using the device that is bricked, you suffer Dumpshock

##### Repairing Matrix Damage
- Repairable with a toolkit, an hour of work, and a [[Matrix Skills#Hardware]] + [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG]] [Mental] test.
	- Each hit repairs one box or cuts the time requirement in half
- If critically glitch while attempting to repair, the device is permanently bricked
- If glitch while attempting to repair, the device becomes glitchy, to the gamemaster's specification (or in a particular moment)

##### Biofeedback Damage
Biofeedback damage is Matrix code that forces your sim module to misbehave badly. It makes your body go haywire the same way that Matrix damage screws up devices. This can cause temporary or even permanent damage to a deckers’ body and brain. It’s used by Black IC, Grid Overwatch Division G-men, and unscrupulous hackers and spiders, although it can also come from other sources inadvertently, like dumpshock or the damage riggers take when their vehicles and drones are damaged. Biofeedback damage is only dangerous when you’re in VR mode. Unless the attack says otherwise, biofeedback is Stun damage if you are using cold-sim VR and Physical damage in hot-sim VR. You resist biofeedback damage with [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL]] + [[Matrix Attributes#Firewall]]

##### Dumpshock and Link-Locking
When you’re disconnected from the Matrix while in VR without gracefully switching to AR first, you suffer a nasty shock as your sim module kicks out. This happens to hackers so often it has its own name: dumpshock. The Damage Value for dumpshock is 6S if you’re in cold-sim and 6P if you’re in hot-sim. Dumpshock is [[#Biofeedback Damage]]. As if that weren’t enough, you’re also disoriented and take a –2 dice pool modifier on all of your actions for (10 – [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL]]) minutes. Remember that if you’re being dumped because your deck just got bricked, you don’t have a functional Firewall attribute any more, so only use your Willpower. Another danger in the Matrix is having your connection link-locked. This is when another persona or device sends keep-alive signals to your deck (or other device) that force it to cancel any attempt to leave the Matrix. If you’re link-locked, you can’t use the Switch Interface Mode, the Enter/Exit Host, or the Reboot actions on the device your persona is using (probably your deck). You can escape with a successful Jack Out (p. 240) action. Successfully jacking out usually means suffering dumpshock, but at least you’re free. Any persona, be they agent, technomancer, or sprite, can be link-locked. Usually, if you fall unconscious in VR, your commlink or deck automatically switches you to AR. If you’re linklocked, you remain online and in VR. IC typically doesn’t care whether its target is conscious, so it will probably keep attacking you. Spiders are a bit smarter about it but no less ruthless, and they have a lot of options when you’re helpless and stuck in the Matrix. Either way, it’s nasty, since you can’t defend against actions when you’re unconscious.
