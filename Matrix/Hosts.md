[[Matrix]]

![[Sample Host Ratings.png]]

##### Host Archives
Hosts have areas called archives that hold files not actively in use. If you want an archived file, you will need to convince someone who already has a [[MARK]] on the file to bring it out of the archive first

##### Host Attributes
- ranges from 1-12
- Hosts have all 4 [[Matrix Attributes]], with a rating typically (Host Rating, +1, 2, 3)
	- shared by itself and its IC

##### Host Convergence
Your [[Overwatch Score]] continues to accumulate while in a host, but rather than being dumped from the matrix as you are typically when reaching convergence, the host instead [[MARK]]s you 3 times and starts deploying IC
- if you leave a host while converged, the demiGOD immediately converges on you, so it is better to simply jack out of the host.

##### IC
- Intrusion Countermeasures
- each IC program has a personal with its own Condition Monitor and Initiative Score
- Treated as if in hot-sim so gets 4d6 initiative dice
- shares Marks with host, so if spotted by host, spotted by IC
- A host can launch one IC per Combat Turn, at the beginning of the turn.
	- can have up to host rating number of IC active
- Only IC always active is patrol IC
- A failed attack causes damage to the IC as with all attack actions

**Types of IC:**
##### ACID
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Firewall
Acid IC targets and overwrites your protective software.
When it gets 1 or more net hits on its attack, it
reduces your Firewall by 1. If your Firewall has been reduced
to 0 already, it causes 1 DV Matrix damage per
net hit on the attack. The reduction is cumulative and
lasts until you reboot the targeted device.

##### BINDER
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Data
Processing
Binder IC corrupts your base operating system.
When it gets 1 or more net hits on its attack, it reduces
your Data Processing by 1. If your Data Processing has
been reduced to 0 already, it causes 1 DV Matrix damage
per net hit on the attack. The reduction is cumulative
and lasts until you reboot the targeted device.

##### BLACK IC
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall
Black IC is the most feared intrusion countermeasures
program on the market. The hosts that run it don’t want
you repelled—they want you dead. When it hits, Black
IC link-locks you. It also causes (Attack) DV Matrix damage
(+1 DV per net hit and +2 DV per mark on the target)
along with an equal amount of biofeedback damage.

##### BLASTER
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Logic + Firewall
Also known as Grey IC, a Blaster IC program’s attack
causes (Attack) DV Matrix damage, +1 DV per net
hit and +2 DV per mark on the target, with biofeedback
damage. The biofeedback from a Blaster program can
only cause Stun damage. A single successful attack also
link-locks the target.

##### CRASH
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall
If Crash IC has a mark on you (through its host) and
hits, one of your programs crashes, selected at random.
Programs crashed this way can’t be run again until after
a reboot.

##### JAMMER
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Attack
Jammer IC turns your firewall against your own attacks.
When it gets 1 or more net hits on its attack, it reduces
your Attack by 1. If your Attack has been reduced
to 0 already, it causes 1 DV Matrix damage per net hit
on the attack. The reduction is cumulative and lasts until
you reboot the targeted device.

##### KILLER
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall
This IC is a simple but effective cybercombat program
that causes (Attack) DV Matrix damage (+1 DV per
net hit and +2 DV per mark) on the target with each successful
attack.

##### MARKER
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Sleaze
Marker IC installs tiny worm programs that mess with
your datastreams. When it gets 1 or more net hits on its
attack, it reduces your Sleaze by 1. If your Sleaze has
been reduced to 0 already, it causes 1 DV Matrix damage
per net hit on the attack. The reduction is cumulative
and lasts until you reboot the targeted device.

##### PATROL
Attack: n/a
Patrol IC acts more like an agent than other intrusion
countermeasures. Its job is to patrol a host, scanning
people’s marks and looking for illegal activity using the
Matrix Perception action on all targets in the host. While
the act of placing a mark is an illegal activity, the act of
simply having a mark is not. Once you have the mark,
you are considered a legitimate user. Patrol IC has no
attack, but it shares its information with its parent host.
Since the Patrol IC doesn’t use Attack actions, it doesn’t
take Matrix damage when it fails. Most hosts have Patrol
IC and keep it running all the time.

##### PROBE
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall
The task of Probe IC is to mark intruders for other IC.
Every successful “attack” means another mark for the
host and its IC on the target, up to the maximum of three
marks.

##### SCRAMBLE
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Firewall
Scramble IC nukes your connection to the Matrix and
forces you to reboot. If the host has three marks on you
when this IC hits you, you reboot immediately, taking
dumpshock if you were in VR.

##### SPARKY
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall
Sparky IC is also known as “Psycho Killer,” an upgraded
version of the popular Killer IC. It causes (Attack) DV
Matrix damage (+1 DV per net hit and +2 DV per mark
on the target) with biofeedback damage.

##### TAR BABY
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Logic + Firewall
The Tar Baby IC link-locks you when it hits. If you’re
already link-locked, it puts a mark on you, up to a maximum
of three marks.

##### TRACK
Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Sleaze
Track IC follows the datastreams between your icon
and your deck. If this IC hits and the host has two marks
or more on you, the host (and its owners) discover your
physical location, which is usually reported to real-world
authorities immediately.
