Riggers serve in a lot of roles in the Sixth World. They most often serve as drivers (obviously), although only a small percentage of professional drivers—bus and taxi drivers, chauffeurs, delivery drivers, and so on—actually spring for a control rig. Drivers who need to be very precise or very efficient, like high-speed couriers, race drivers, emergency service drivers, etc., have a much higher chance of being riggers. Riggers can perform a large number of services using drones, controlled remotely from a central location. Traffic monitoring and police beats are often covered by drones, usually flying ones. Riggers use drones for hazardous jobs, like reactor maintenance, firefighting, mining, and demolitions. Drones are often the first forces to arrive at a violent crime scene, partly because they’re faster, but mostly because it’s safer for law enforcement. Riggers don’t have to stick to vehicles and drones. Other devices can be adapted for rigger control, too. Mounted turrets, especially water cannons on firefighting trucks and anti-aircraft batteries on naval vessels, are often rigged. There’s a specialized rigger interface for musical instruments that only partly overrides the user’s motor function so he can still play to an audience on stage. There are a lot of large and/or secure facilities that have a rigger running and monitoring the entire building

##### TAKING THE JUMP
If you want to jump into a vehicle (or drone, or turret, or
articulated six-axis arc welder), there are some prerequisites.
You need an implanted control rig (if you don’t
have that, you’re in the wrong chapter), you need to be
the owner of or have three marks on the vehicle or drone
you’re jumping into, and of course you need the vehicle
to have rigger interface gear.
	Jumping into a vehicle is a Complex Action if you’re
in AR, or a Simple Action if you’re already in VR when
you make the jump. If you’re using a direct connection
and already plugged into the vehicle or RCC, you can
jump into a vehicle directly from your meat body by taking
a Simple Action.
	From the Matrix, your icon and the device icon
merge into a single icon. Usually, it’s just your icon there,
but you can make it look like something else if you want
separate icons indicating “you” and “you jumped into a
rigged death machine.”

##### VR AND RIGGING
When you’re jumped into a vehicle or other device, you’re
in Virtual Reality mode. The control rig allows you to treat
Vehicle actions the same way you treat Matrix actions, so
any bonus you get to Matrix actions also apply to Vehicle
actions when you’re jumped in; this includes Vehicle Control
Tests, Gunnery Tests, and Sensor Tests.
Just like in the Matrix, you have the option of using
cold-sim or hot-sim while rigging. If you’re using coldsim,
you get +2D6 to your Initiative (3D6 total), and any
biofeedback damage you take is Stun. If you’re using
hot-sim, you get +3D6 (4D6 total) Initiative dice, and
a +1 dice pool bonus that applies to all Matrix test (including
Vehicle actions), but all biofeedback damage is
Physical damage.

##### RIGGING AND LIMITS
When you’re jumped into a vehicle, drone, or other device,
the limits of that device are increased by the rating
of your control rig. This includes vehicle and drone Sensor,
Speed, and Handling, and the Accuracy of mounted
weapons when used by the rigger. The control rig also
connects more smoothly through an RCC when operating
in VR.

##### NOISE AND RIGGING
If you’re rigging via wireless, all of your actions suffer
from a Noise penalty (see p. 230). If you’re using a direct
connection, you don’t have to worry about Noise
at all. A rigger’s data cable gets a lot of use for this reason.

##### PHYSICAL DAMAGE
Whenever the vehicle or other device you’re jumped
into takes Physical damage, the feedback can hurt you.
Whenever the vehicle or drone you’re jumped into takes
boxes of damage, you must resist half (rounded up) of
that damage as Biofeedback damage (p. 229).

##### MATRIX DAMAGE
When you take Matrix damage, it goes to the first device
you’re using for your persona, not the device you’re
jumped into. If you used your commlink or rigger command
console to enter VR before jumping in, your commlink
or RCC (respectively) is the target of Matrix damage
to your persona. If you’re directly connected to the vehicle
you’re jumped into, the vehicle takes the Matrix damage.

##### JUMPING OUT
When you want to jump out of a vehicle, drone, or other
device, you use the Switch Interface Mode action
(see Switch Interface Action Mode, p. 243) to go to VR
or AR. If you’re using a rigger command console, you
can instead use the Jump into Rigged Device action to
jump directly to another device on your PAN.
If the vehicle, drone, or device you’re jumped into
is destroyed while you’re jumped in, you suffer dumpshock
(6 DV biofeedback damage, p. 229).

##### RIGGERS AND DECKERS
As you’ve probably already guessed from all this talk
about Matrix damage, the hacker is the rigger’s natural
enemy. While riggers and deckers do have a lot of
similarities—sharing a few programs, using gear in the
Matrix, lots of time in VR—don’t get the two confused.
Deckers and technomancers may rule the Matrix, but
riggers have great power in the meat world. So respect
the hackers, but don’t fear them. Their software can
mess with your hardware, but your headware can mess
with their wetware, usually in the form of cranial trauma
by gunshot wound. Or tire tracks in sensitive places.
