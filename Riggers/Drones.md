[[Riggers]]

Drones are unmanned vehicles intended to be used remotely
by riggers or run autonomously. Of course, any
vehicle or other machine with a rigger interface can be
run remotely by riggers or autonomously, but drones
tend to be cheaper, more specialized to their function,
and don’t need to pay for parking. Still, the rules for
drones apply to any remotely controlled or rigged device,
but between us chummers let’s just say “drone”
because it’s shorter.

##### DRONES IN THE MATRIX
Drones are devices, so they show up in the Matrix. This
can make them a target for enemy hackers, but it also
means you can reach your drone from anywhere on the
planet. If you’re jumped into a drone, the drone’s Matrix
icon and your device’s icon merge. When jumped
into a drone (or any vehicle for that matter) the attacker
can only target you (your persona and the device it’s
on) and not your drone. When you’re not jumped in,
your drone becomes a valid target once again.
The Device Rating of a drone is the same as its Pilot
Rating, meaning all of its Matrix attributes are equal to
the Pilot Rating.

##### PILOT PROGRAMS
Pilots (the programs, not the people) are not bright.
They’re called “dog-brains” by those who have to work
with them, much the same way a particularly thick person
might be called a “drone-head” by those who work
with him.
	A pilot program is specific to the device it’s in. You
can’t just copy a program from one device and move it
into a different one. After a week or so, the pilot is so
adapted to the specific vehicle, drone, or other device
that it’s useless in anything else, even other devices of
the same model.
	Pilots have a Rating indicated by the Device Rating
of the vehicle, drone, or other piece of gear they’re
in. This rating is used in place of any Mental attribute
needed for a test, but it hardly makes up for a metahuman
brain. When faced with something novel or unexpected,
or a complicated command, a Pilot program
must make a Device Rating x 2 Test against a threshold
set by the gamemaster based on how confusing
the situation is. If it fails this test, it blithely continues
doing what it was doing before, or simply stops entirely
and asks for instructions.

##### AUTOSOFTS
Autosofts are specialized programs designed to increase
the effectiveness of a drone’s performance. In
other words, people have skills, drones have autosofts.
An autosoft is rated between 1 and 6. A drone has a
number of slots to use for autosofts and cyberprograms
equal to half its Device Rating, rounded up. Swapping
autosofts and programs is a Complex Matrix Action.
Here’s a short list of autosoft programs. An autosoft
with the term [Model] in it means that each copy is for a
specific model of drone or vehicle; for example, a Steel
Lynx Maneuvering autosoft only works for Steel Lynx
drones and is useless in a Nissan Jackrabbit or a Doberman
drone.
- Clearsight: This acts as the drone’s Perception skill.
Electronic Warfare: Exactly like the Electronic Warfare
skill.
- [Model] Evasion: This autosoft teaches the drones
autopilot how to avoid being locked onto by Sensors.
- [Model] Maneuvering: This is like a Pilot [Vehicle
type] skill, except that it only applies to one specific
drone model.
- [Model] Stealth: This autosoft helps a drone of a
specific model operate with as much stealth as possible
and acts as the Infiltration skill for the drone.
- [Weapon] Targeting: This is the Gunnery skill, but for
a weapon of a specific model. If you mount an Ingram
Smartgun, you’ll need an Ingram Smartgun Targeting
autosoft for it.

If a drone is slaved to a rigger command console and
isn’t running any of its own programs, it uses the programs
running on the RCC. This can exceed its normal
program limit.

##### DRONE COMBAT
Rules for drone combat are the same as those for regular
flesh-and-blood characters and can be found in the Combat
chapter (p. 158). Specific rules for using Gunnery and
Sensors in combat can be found there as well (p. 202).

##### DRONE PERCEPTION
A drone observes its surroundings with a Pilot + Clearsight
[Sensor] Test. If you’re jumped into the drone,
you make a Perception + Intuition [Sensor] Test. Either
way, you get to use the drone’s entire sensor suite, if
it has one.

##### DRONE INFILTRATION
Drones sometimes need to be sneaky. When this
occurs, a few things need to be taken into consideration.
When operating independently, drones roll
Pilot + Stealth [Handling] vs. Perception + Intuition
[Mental]. You might want to put your drone into
silent running mode, or its Matrix icon would be a
dead giveaway of their presence to anyone scanning
the scene in the Matrix. When jumped in, the test is
Stealth + Intuition [Handling] vs. Perception + Intuition
[Mental]; you probably want your persona operating
under silent running while you’re at it.

##### DRONE INITIATIVE
Drones acting autonomously have an Initiative attribute
of Pilot Rating x 2, and get 3D6 additional Initiative
Dice (for a total of 4D6). When jumped in, the
drone uses the VR initiative of the rigger.

##### REPAIRING DRONES
Drones have two damage tracks, Physical and Matrix.
Fill up either one and it’s bye-bye birdie as the drone is
either irreparably destroyed and joins the spare parts
collections, or it gets bricked and it’s time to completely
rewire its guts. But up until that final box is filled, damage
done to a drone can be repaired.
Repairing Physical damage follows the rules for
building and repair on p. 145. To repair Matrix damage,
check out Repairing Matrix Damage, p. 228.
If the chassis and the electronics of your drone get
trashed, it will probably cost you more to fix it than buy a
new one. But if it has sentimental value, ain’t it worth it?
