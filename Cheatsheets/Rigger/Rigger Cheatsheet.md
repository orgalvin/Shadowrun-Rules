# Rigger Skills
Rigging skills are Vehicle Active skills, including all skills that begin with the word 'Pilot', plus the Gunnery Skill

Pilot skills: Skill Rating + REA
Gunnery: Skill Rating + AGI

# Control Methods
(See [[Jumping In]] for prerequisites)

There are 4 methods to control a vehicle/drone/device.  In order of priority:
- [[Rigger Control]], from [[Jumping In]]
- [[Remote Control]], from the [[Control Device]] action
- [[Manual Control]], from real physical controls
- [[Autopilot]] from a [[Pilot Program]]

- Commands sent on a higher priority method override commands sent on lower ones
- If a device gets multiple commands on the same priority method, it does nothing instead

# Noise
While rigging wirelessly, all actions suffer from [[Noise]].  A direct connection ignores the effects of [[Noise]].

# RCC modes
- When you boot up your [[RCC]], choose between two stats
	- Noise Reduction: stacks with other forms of noise reduction
	- Sharing: how many [[Autosoft]] you can simultaneous run on all slaved drones at the same time
- You can change mode with [[Change Device Mode]] 

# Data Processing and Firewall
[[Data Processing]]
- determines [[Initiative]] in [[VR]]
- acts as [[Limit]] for any [[Command]] tests through the RCC
[[Firewall]] used to defend against unwanted wireless intrusion

# Control Device
A character may use a Free Action to activate, deactivate, or switch the mode on any device that he is linked to by a direct neural interface through either a wired or wireless link. 

This includes
- activating cyberware
- changing a smartgun’s firing mode
- changing a smartlinked shotgun’s choke
- deactivating thermographic vision
- switching a commlink to hidden mode
- turning a device’s wireless functionality off,

Note that it takes longer to interact with some devices, as noted in individual gear descriptions.
