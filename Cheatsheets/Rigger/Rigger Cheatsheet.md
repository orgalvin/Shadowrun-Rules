# Rigger Skills
Rigging skills are Vehicle Active skills, including all skills that begin with the word 'Pilot', plus the Gunnery Skill

# Control Methods
There are 4 methods to control a vehicle/drone/device.  In order of priority:
- [[Rigger Control]], from [[Jumping In]]
- [[Remote Control]], from the [[Control Device]] action
- [[Manual Control]], from real physical controls
- [[Autopilot]] from a [[Pilot Program]]

- Commands sent on a higher priority method override commands sent on lower ones
- If a device gets multiple commands on the same priority method, it does nothing instead

# RCC modes
- When you boot up your [[RCC]], choose between two stats
	- Noise Reduction: stacks with other forms of noise reduction
	- Sharing: how many [[Autosoft]] you can simultaneous run on all slaved drones at the same time
- You can change mode with [[Change Device Mode]] 

# Data Processing and Firewall
[[Data Processing]]
- determines [[Initiative]] in [[VR]]
- acts as [[Limit]] for any [[Command]] tests through the RCC
[[Firewall]] used to defend against unwanted wireless intrusion
