# Requirements
- Implanted control rig ([[RCC]])
- Either one of:
	- Ownership of the device
	- 3 marks on the device
- Vehicle needs to have [[Rigger Interface Gear]]

# Action cost
- If in [[AR]], it requires a [[Complex Action]]
- If in [[VR]], it only requires a [[Simple Action]]
- If you're directly connected to the vehicle or using an [[RCC]], it's a [[Simple Action]]

Note: in the [[Matrix]] it looks like your icon and the device icon merge (usually it becomes your icon)

# Bonuses for you
While you're jumped in, you're in VR

You also gain the following effects:
- Treat  [[Vehicle Actions]] the same way you'd treat [[Matrix Actions]]
- Any bonus to [[Matrix Actions]] also applies to [[Vehicle Actions]]
	- Vehicle Control Tests
	-  Gunnery Tests
	-  Sensor Tests

## Cold / Hot Sim
You choose between [[Cold-Sim]] and [[Hot-Sim]]

[[Cold-Sim]]:
- +2D6 to Initiative (3D6 total)
- Damage taken is [[Stun Damage]]

[[Hot Sim]]:
- +3D6 to Initiative (4D6 total)
- Extra +1 dice pool bonus for all [[Matrix Actions]] (including [[Vehicle Tests]] because you're jumped in)
- All [[Biofeedback Damage]] becomes [[Physical Damage]]

# Device Bonuses
All Vehicle/Drone device limits are increased by your RCC device rating:
- Sensor
- Speed
- Handling
- Accuracy of mounted weapons

Attackers can only target you (aka your persona and the device it's on) and not the device itself


# Damage to Device
## Physical Damage
If a device you're jumped into takes boxes of damage, you must resist half (rounded up) as [[Biofeedback Damage]] damage (roll [[Willpower]] + [[Firewall]])

## Matrix Damage
If you take [[Matrix Damage]] it goes to the outermost layer of control - usually your commlink or [[RCC]].  If you're directly connected, the vehicle takes the damage.

## Dumpshock
See below


# Jumping Out
## On Purpose
There are two ways to jump out of a device:
- You can use [[Switch Interface Action Mode]] to go to [[VR]] or [[AR]]
- If you're using an [[RCC]], you can also jump directly to anything in your [[PAN]]

## Getting Dumped
You can also get dumped, which means you're forced out because:
- The vehicle is destroyed or bricked
- Your commlink or RCC is destroyed
- Your direct connection is broken

In all cases you take 6 DV of [[Biofeedback Damage]] and lose control
- If the vehicle has a [[Pilot Rating]] it will return to autopilot control next turn
- Otherwise it's uncontrolled
