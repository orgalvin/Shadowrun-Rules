# Requirements
- Implanted control rig ([[RCC]])
- Either one of:
	- Ownership of the device
	- 3 marks on the device
- Vehicle needs to have [[Rigger Interface Gear]]

# Action cost
- If in [[AR]], it requires a [[Complex Action]]
- If in [[VR]], it only requires a [[Simple Action]]
- If you're directly connected to the vehicle or using an [[RCC]], it's a [[Simple Action]]

Note: in the [[Matrix]] it looks like your icon and the device icon merge (usually it becomes your icon)

# Device Bonuses
All Vehicle/Drone device limits are increased by your RCC device rating:
- Sensor
- Speed
- Handling
- Accuracy of mounted weapons

# Damage to Device
## Physical Damage
If a device you're jumped into takes boxes of damage, you must resist half (rounded up) as [[Biofeedback Damage]] damage

## Matrix Damage
If you take [[Matrix Damage]] it goes to the outermost layer of control - usually your commlink or [[RCC]].  If you're directly connected, the vehicle takes the damage.

## Dumpshock
If you're jumped into a device and it's destroyed, you suffer 6 DV of [[Biofeedback Damage]]

# Jumping Out
There are two ways to jump out of a device:
- You can use [[Switch Interface Action Mode]] to go to [[VR]] or [[AR]]
- If you're using an [[RCC]], you can also jump directly to anything in your [[PAN]]
