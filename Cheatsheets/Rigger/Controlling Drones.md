Drones almost always have [[Rigger Interface Gear]] and are designed to be operated by [[Riggers]].

Drones are devices, so they show up in the Matrix:
- They can be targeted by Deckers
- You can control them anywhere on the planet

# Creating a [[PAN]]
- Your [[RCC]] can handle up to (Device Rating x 3) slaved drones
- The slaved drones plus your master RCC is called a [[PAN]]

## Effects on drones
- When making a [[Defense Test]], drones use the best rating between itself / master for each rating in the test
- Marks on a slaved device in a [[PAN]] also create a mark on the master
- You can give a command to one, all, or some of your slaved drones with the same [[Simple Action]]
- Commands issued from your RCC aracted on during the droneâ€™s Action Phase, not yours

# Electronic Warfare
## Dealing with Noise
As noise compensation, you can take a [[Complex Action]] and make an [[Electronic Warfare]] + [[Logic (Data Processing)]] test.  The hits act as [[Noise]] reduction (cumulative with other sources) for the rest of the current [[Combat Turn Sequence]].

You can also buy a [[Jammer]]

## Getting Hacked
- You can defend against [[Matrix Combat Actions]] by using [[Full Matrix Defense]]
- You can temporarily disable a device by using [[Reboot Device]]
	- Even a flying drone is probably fine rebooting mid-air
	- Very fancy drones might need to land first

# Autosofts
Complicated commands to an Autosoft need to pass a [[Device Rating]] x 2 test against GM threshold
