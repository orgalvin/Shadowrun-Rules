# Mission Log
## 20790904 - 20790905 Case of the wannabe warlock
Start the night at the [[Places#Pitstop|Pitstop]], chilling at a booth together.

Get a job to find Jinni Jones who is a daughter of someone who works at Pacific Industrial in a middle management role. She seems to have gone missing along with another woman Sara who belongs to a different corpo family.

Initially head to where she lives on the west side of town. A large skyscraper that Pacific Industrial Corpo owns. Pacific Industrial is a small sized corp that deals in industrial shipping. 

Butler is our Johnson who meets us there and lets us up to the 16th floor. Find magic shit in one of the rooms. Use her commlink to see logs between her and someone called TheMediaMagus on a forum called Forum Arcanum. Latest chats were talking about meeting up an hour ago (in game time) at club called Warlock's Lodge in the Northern Barrens.

From there we find Sara. Learn that Jinni and Nick (TheMediaMagus) have left separately. We track them down and kill Nick, and get Jinni back to the butler.

Initial gain was 25000 nuyen for the job for everyone, then Gyoubu was able to get the cost up to 30000 after we learn that there's magical shit going on.






# Other time notes
## Just generally around now
Much of the [[Corps and other entities#United Canadian and American States UCAS|UCAS]] is currently a political battleground between the working classes and the corpos, with a recent policy proposal about workers' right to privacy catalyzing wide spread protests. After months of stalemate, brutal law enforcement, and heavy-handed strike-breaking tactics, bitterness and tensions are at an all time high.
