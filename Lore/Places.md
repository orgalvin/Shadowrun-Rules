Where we're established.

#### Pitstop
*Food, Contacts*
Pitstop is a run-down neighborhood bar run by an ex-racer by the name of [[People#Crash|Crash]]. With stained concrete floors and a counter that'll put as many splinters in ya as drinks, the main draw of the place is it's position as the only gang-unaffiliated watering hole in the neighborhood. People find a bit of safety in that fact, and as a result it's become your go-to forum for job requests and a quick (if a bit greasy) bite.

#### Wooded Acres
*Residential*
Wooded Acres is an apartment complex anyone could live in if they want to - it's a bit run-down given its poor construction and poor management, sporting stained walls and crumbling mortar. Alright, maybe the place is more than 'a bit' run-down. But the rent is to die for!
