"Over the next week we will take the first steps for this program, targeting southern Redmond, with an aim to expand through the rest of east side by the end of the year. The 'Safer Streets Act' will improve the lives of our Seattle families, friends, and neighbors as we rehabilitate our homeless, providing them housing and new job training to get them off of the street and back into society" - Mayor Finch

From Diane: Police have been diverted to the Safer Streets initiative. They are using contractors from [[Corps and other entities#Aries|Aries]] to shore up their numbers. Other corps seem to be investigating what Aries is doing.
