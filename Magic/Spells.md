#### Combat Spells
Combat spells use mana to create damaging effects, either by direct or indirect means. They’re a mana-slinger’s guns, and are treated that way by law enforcement.

**Direct**: When your direct combat spell is successfully cast, it inflicts a number of boxes of damage equal to your net hits on the opposed test. The opposed test generally pits your [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]][Force] against either [[Attribute#BODY BOD|Body]] (for physical spells) or [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]] (for mana spells). The target does not get to resist the damage, only the Spellcasting test.

**Indirect**: All indirect combat spells originate near the magician’s body (most magicians use their hands or eyes, but some use their feet for “power kicks” or emanate power from the entire body for a kind of an aura-throwing effect). The spell then is launched with an Opposed Test that pits the magician’s [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]][Force] versus the target’s [[Attribute#REACTION REA|Reaction]] + [[Attribute#INTUITION INT|Intuition]], kind of like shooting a gun (in this case with bullets made of acid, or fire, or something equally unpleasant to be hit by). So you don’t really need to be able to see the target—you can cast these spells blindfolded or with artificial image enhancement—as long as you’ve got a clear line of fire. The Damage Value of a successful indirect combat spell is Force + net hits, with an AP equal to –(Force). Damage from an indirect combat spell is resisted with Body + Armor (adjusted for the spell’s AP). Area indirect spells travel from the magician to the point of detonation and then go boom. The test is like that for grenades (p. 181): a [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]][Force] (3) Test with scatter of 2D6 meters. Unlike grenades, you get to add your net hits on this test to the Damage Value of the spell, but only if you beat the threshold; otherwise the spell still detonates, but the hits are used to reduce scatter by one meter per hit.

Elemental: These spells cause extra [[Elemental Damage]]. The specific type is listed in the spell description.

##### ACID STREAM 
(INDIRECT, ELEMENTAL)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: I Drain: F – 3 Damage: P
##### TOXIC WAVE 
(INDIRECT, ELEMENTAL)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: I Drain: F – 1 Damage: P

These spells create a powerful corrosive that sprays the target, causing terrible burns and eating away organic and metallic material—treat it as [[Elemental Damage#Acid|Acid]] damage, with appropriate effects on the affected area and any objects therein. The acid quickly evaporates, but the damage it inflicts remains. Acid Stream is a single-target spell, Toxic Wave is an area spell.

##### PUNCH
(INDIRECT)
Type: P Duration: I Range: T Drain: F – 6 Damage: S 
##### CLOUT
(INDIRECT)
Type: P Duration: I Range: LOS Drain: F – 3 Damage: S 
##### BLAST
(INDIRECT)
Type: P Duration: I Range: LOS (A) Drain: F Damage: S 

These spells smack the target(s) with invisible psychokinetic force, similar to a bruising punch, that inflicts Stun damage. Punch requires you to touch the target, Clout affects a single target, and Blast is an area spell.

##### DEATH TOUCH
(DIRECT)
Type: M Duration: I Range: T Drain: F-6 Damage: P 
##### MANABOLT
(DIRECT)
Type: M Duration: I Range: LOS Drain: F-3 Damage: P 
##### MANABALL
(DIRECT)
Type: M Duration: I Range: LOS (A) Drain: F Damage: P 

Death Touch, Manabolt, and Manaball all channel destructive magical power into the target, doing Physical damage. The damage inflicted is similar to massive cellular die off from radiation or necrotizing fasciitis, but without the continuing effects. But still, ick. Since they are mana spells, spells in this group only affect living and magical targets and are resisted with [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]]. Death Touch requires the magician to touch the target. Manabolt affects a single target, Manaball is an area-effect spell.

##### FLAMETHROWER 
(INDIRECT, ELEMENTAL)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: I Drain: F – 3 Damage: P
##### FIREBALL 
(INDIRECT, ELEMENTAL)
Type: P Range: LOS(A) Duration: I Drain: F – 1 Damage: P

These spells create an explosion of flames that flash into existence and scorch the target(s), giving them the double benefit of causing pain and being intimidating as hell. These spells deal [[Elemental Damage#Fire|Fire]] damage.These flames burn out after striking the target, but their secondary effects may ignite flammable materials that continue to burn after the spell is exhausted. Flamethrower is a single-target spell, while Fireball is an area spell.

##### LIGHTNING BOLT 
(INDIRECT, ELEMENTAL)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: I Drain: F – 3 Damage: P
##### BALL LIGHTNING 
(INDIRECT, ELEMENTAL)
Type: P Range: LOS(A) Duration: I Drain: F – 1 Damage: P

These spells create and direct vicious strikes of electricity that cause [[Elemental Damage#Electric|Electric]] damage (p. 170). Lightning Bolt is a single target spell. Ball Lightning is an area spell.

##### SHATTER
(DIRECT)
Type: P Duration: I Range: T Drain: F – 6 Damage: P
##### POWERBOLT
(DIRECT)
Type: P Duration: I Range: LOS Drain: F – 3 Damage: P
##### POWERBALL
(DIRECT)
Type: P Duration: I Range: LOS (A) Drain: F Damage: P

These spells channel destructive magical power into the targets causing Physical damage. The target is cooked from the inside, like magically microwaving a hot dog. As physical energies, they can affect both living and non-living targets and are resisted by the target’s [[Attribute#BODY BOD|Body]]. Shatter requires you to touch the target, Powerbolt affects a single target, and Powerball is an area spell.

##### KNOCKOUT
(DIRECT)
Type: M Duration: I Range: T Drain: F – 6 Damage: S
##### STUNBOLT
(DIRECT)
Type: M Duration: I Range: LOS Drain: F – 3 Damage: S
##### STUNBALL
(DIRECT)
Type: M Duration: I Range: LOS (A) Drain: F Damage: S

These spells channel magical energy directly into the target, causing Stun damage. They are sometimes referred to as “sleep” spells because they can render targets unconscious but keep them alive, in the cases where you’d prefer more polite violence. Knockout re- quires the magician to touch the target, Stunbolt affects a single target, and Stunball is an area spell.

#### Detection Spells
Detection spells give the subject a new sense (beyond the normal five) or improve a sense the subject already has, for as long as they are sustained. Detection spells may be cast upon yourself or on another subject within touch range. The standard range of the sense a Detection spell grants is the spell’s [[Magic#Force|Force]] x caster’s [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] in meters as a radius from the target of the spell. Extended-range detection spells have a [[Magic#Force|Force]]  x [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] x 10 meter range. The more net hits you get when casting the spell, the more detailed information you receive.

Using the extra or enhanced sense may require the subject to Observe in Detail as a Simple Action ([[Using Perception]]). Detection spells are either directional (like normal sight), area effect (work in all directions at once, like hearing), or psychic (providing some other special sense such as telepathy or precognition).

The sense is either active, requiring special efforts or actions to use, or passive, meaning it enhances the abilities of those affected without them having to take separate actions.

**Active**: Active detection spells involve an Opposed Test between the caster’s [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]][Force] and either [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]] + [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG|Logic]] (+ Counterspelling if available) [Mental] for living things with auras, ([[Magic#Force|Force]] x 2) for magical objects, or the object resistance for mundane objects (p. 295). Counterspelling may be used to defend against active detection spells, even if the target is unaware of them being cast (for example, if they walk within range of an active Detect Enemies spell).

When a spell affects multiple targets, either because it has an area effect or because it is sustained and may be encountered by multiple people, you should only make a single Spellcasting Test. Every potential target then makes an individual Spell Resistance Test and compares their result to yours. New targets may be detected as they enter the range of the spell, and they must make a Spell Resistance Test against your original Spellcasting Test.

**Passive**: A passive sense is simply “on” and feeds sensory input to the subject’s brain like other senses—no interpretation necessary. While the spell is sustained, [[Skill#PERCEPTION INTUITION|Perception]] Tests using this sense have a limit equal to the net successes from casting of the spell instead of the subject’s Mental limit. [[Magic#Counterspelling|Counterspelling]] cannot be used to defend against a passive sense, but once an opposing spellcaster realizes there is an active sustained spell, she can try [[Magic#Dispelling|Dispelling]] it.

**Glitches**: A glitch on a Detection Spellcasting Test may result in false or misleading information. Likewise, a critical glitch may inflict extra [[Magic#Drain|Drain]] (e.g., +2 Drain Value), translate any Drain damage suffered into Physical Damage, temporarily strip the subject of a sense, or inexplicably apply the intended sense to others (particularly opponents) in range—hopefully they’ll remember to thank you for your help in spotting you and your team.

##### ANALYZE DEVICE
(ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL)
Type: P Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 3  

This spell allows the subject to analyze the purpose and operation of a device or piece of equipment within range of the sense. The casting of the spell is opposed by the object’s resistance (p. 295). Each net hit can be used to provide a piece of information about the device that would not be readily apparent (for example, it would not give the information that it is a Renraku-manufactured device if the thing is emblazoned with a huge Renraku logo, but it might say what the basic function of the thing is). Each net hit also gives the subject a bonus die while operating the device and allows the subject to ignore any skill-defaulting modifiers for using it as long as the spell is sustained.

##### ANALYZE MAGIC
(ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL)
Type: P Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 3

This spell allows the subject to analyze the purpose of a magical object (e.g., foci, alchemical preparations, magical lodges, active rituals). Treat the net hits from the Spellcasting Test as hits on the [[Assensing Table.png]], except the subject isn’t required to be perceiving astrally.

##### ANALYZE TRUTH
(ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 2

The subject can tell whether a target’s statements are the truth (or at least if the subject honestly believes them to be true).The spell needs at least 1 net hit to determine validity of a selected statement. The spell does not work on written materials or items recorded through any sort of technological medium. The subject must hear a statement in person (with the target within range) to be able to judge its truth.

##### CLAIRAUDIENCE
(PASSIVE, DIRECTIONAL)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 3

The subject can hear distant sounds as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The listening point may be moved to any other point within range of the spell as a Complex Action. While using Clairaudience, the subject cannot use her normal hearing. This spell doesn’t translate visual images, only sounds (and only sounds within the subject’s natural range of hearing; augmented hearing does not apply).

##### CLAIRVOYANCE
(PASSIVE, DIRECTIONAL)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 3

The subject can see distant scenes as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The visual point may be moved to any other point within range of the spell as a Complex Action. The subject can’t use normal vision or astral perception while using Clairvoyance. This spell doesn’t translate sound, only vision, and it doesn’t work with augmented vision. You can’t target spells through Clairvoyance.

##### COMBAT SENSE
(PASSIVE, PSYCHIC)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F

The subject can subconsciously analyze combat and other dangerous situations within range, sensing events a split-second before they happen. Every hit on the Spellcasting Test adds 1 die for Reaction on Surprise Tests, and also to rolls made when defending against ranged and melee attacks as long as the spell remains in effect.

![[Detection Spell Results.png]]

##### DETECT ENEMIES 
(ACTIVE, AREA)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 2
##### DETECT ENEMIES, EXTENDED 
(ACTIVE, EXTENDED AREA)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F

The subject can detect living targets within range who have hostile intentions toward him. The spell does not detect traps (since they aren’t alive), nor can it detect someone about to shoot into a crowd at random (since the hostility is not directed at the subject of the spell). The spell can detect targets preparing an ambush or other surprise attack directed at the subject.

##### DETECT INDIVIDUAL
(ACTIVE, AREA)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 3  

The subject can detect the presence of a particularnindividual anywhere within range of the sense. You need to specify the individual during casting, someone you know or at least have met in the past.

##### DETECT LIFE 
(ACTIVE, AREA)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 3
##### DETECT LIFE, EXTENDED
(ACTIVE, EXTENDED AREA)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 1

The subject detects all living beings (but not spirits) within range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. In a crowded area, the spell is virtually useless, picking up a blurred mass of traces of life.

##### DETECT [LIFEFORM]
(ACTIVE, AREA)
Type: M, Range: T, Duration: S, Drain: F - 2
##### DETECT [LIFEFORM], EXTENDED
(ACTIVE, EXTENDED AREA)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F

The subject detects all of a specified type of life form within the range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. This is actually several different spells that must be learned separately, one for each type of life form that a caster might like to detect (Detect Orks, Detect Elves, Detect Dragons, and so forth), which are learned separately.

##### DETECT MAGIC 
(ACTIVE, AREA)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 2
##### DETECT MAGIC, EXTENDED
(ACTIVE, EXTENDED AREA)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F

The subject can detect the presence of all foci, spells, wards, magical lodges, alchemical preparations, active rituals, and spirits within range of the sense. It does not detect Awakened characters or critters, astral signatures, alchemical preparations that that have expired or already triggered, or the effects of permanent spells once they have become permanent.

##### DETECT [OBJECT]
(ACTIVE, AREA)
Type: P Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 2

The subject detects all of a specified type of object within range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. Each type of object requires a separate spell (Detect Guns, Detect Computers, Detect Explosives, and so forth). These spells must all be learned and cast separately.

##### MINDLINK
(ACTIVE, PSYCHIC)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 1

Mindlink allows the magician and one voluntary subject to communicate mentally, exchanging conversation, emotions, and mental images. One hit on the Spellcasting Test is enough to establish the link. The subject must remain within range of the magician for the Mindlink to work.

##### MIND PROBE 
(ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F

This spell allows the subject to telepathically probe the mind of a specific target within range of the sense (chosen when the spell is cast). The target is aware of the probing, though they may not know the source of the spell. The number of net hits you get on the spell determines what kind of information the subject can read, given on the table. The subject may probe for one piece of information per Complex Action while the spell is sustained. Additional uses of Mind Probe against the same target within a number of hours equal to the target’s Willpower inflict a –2 dice pool modifier on the Spellcasting attempt.

![[Mind Probe Table.png]]

#### Health Spells
Health spells can heal physical injury, cure diseases (or inflict symptoms), detoxify poisons or drugs (or mimic their effects), and modify attributes. No techniques currently known to magic can erase Stun damage or cure psychological conditions. All health spells require the magician to physically touch the subject of the spell—this “laying on of hands” is traditional in magical healing lore the world over.

Most health spells are cast with a simple [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] [Force] Test. Exceptions are listed in the spell descriptions.

Essence: Low-Essence characters are more difficult to affect with some health spells. It’s hard to put the body back into its natural state when that state has been unnaturally altered. In game terms, this means you take a dice pool modifier equal to the target’s actual Essence minus his maximum Essence (which will turn out to be 0 or a negative number), rounded up.

##### ANTIDOTE
Type: M Range: T Duration: P Drain: F – 3

This spell helps a poisoned subject overcome a toxin. Casters use it after the target has been poisoned, but be- fore the target needs to make her Toxin Resistance Test, based on the Speed of the toxin. Add the hits from this spell directly to the hits from the Toxin Resistance Test.

##### CURE DISEASE (ESSENCE)
Type: M Range: T Duration: P Drain: F – 4

This spell is used at any point after infection to help a patient overcome illness. The infected character receives a number of additional dice on her Disease Resistance Test equal to the spell’s net hits until the patient recovers (or dies). It does not heal any damage already inflicted by the disease (that requires a separate Healing spell).

##### DECREASE [ATTRIBUTE] (ESSENCE)
Type: P Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 2

This spell weakens the target by decreasing a designated Attribute. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special attri- butes (Initiative, Edge, Essence, Magic, or Resonance). It affects both natural and augmented Attributes.

This spell is cast with an Opposed Spellcasting + Magic [Force] v. (targeted Attribute) + Willpower Test. If the magician wins, the Attribute is reduced by the spell’s net hits. If a Physical Attribute is reduced to 0, the victim is incapacitated and paralyzed. If a Mental Attri- bute is reduced to 0, the victim stands still, mindlessly confused. Decreasing an Attribute also affects any other derived statistics that use it (for example, if Reaction or Intuition is lowered, Initiative is lowered as well) as long as the spell is sustained.

##### DETOX
Type: M Range: T Duration: P Drain: F – 6

The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the toxin’s base DV. A single hit is sufficient to eliminate all symp- toms. Detox does not heal or prevent damage done by toxins, but it eliminates any side effects they may have on the victim (dizziness, hallucinations, nausea, pain and so forth). Detox is the hangover cure of choice among those who can afford it.

##### HEAL (ESSENCE)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain F - 4

Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals a number of boxes of Physical damage equal to the spell’s hits from the Spellcasting Test. Hits can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each hit spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn (you can split hits between healing and reducing time).

Any boxes of Physical damage your target still has after any boxes are healed magically can only be healed by time and rest.

##### INCREASE [ATTRIBUTE] (ESSENCE)
Type: P Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 3  

This spell increases an Attribute (natural or augmented) on a voluntary subject. A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special Attributes (Initiative, Edge, Essence, Magic, or Resonance). The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the (augmented) value of the Attribute being affected. The Attribute is increased by an amount equal to the hits scored, up to the target’s augmented maximum (any hits that would increase the Attribute beyond its augmented maximum are ignored). Each Attribute can only be affected by a single Increase Attribute spell at a time.

Note that increasing an Attribute may affect other derived statistics (Increase Reaction also affects Initiative, for example, while Increase Body adds extra boxes to the character’s Physical Condition Monitor for as long as the spell lasts).

##### INCREASE REFLEXES (ESSENCE)
Type: P Range: T Duration: S Drain: F  

This spell increases the initiative of a subject. Each hit rolled on the Spellcasting Test adds +1 to the target’s Inititive, and every two hits adds one Initiative Die. A character can only be affected by a single Increase Reflexes spell at a time, and the maximum Initiative Dice anyone can have is +5D6.

**OXYGENATE**
Type: P Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 5

This spell oxygenates the blood of a voluntary subject, providing extra Body dice (1 die for every hit) to resist suffocation, strangulation, the effects of inhaled gas, or any other effect of oxygen deprivation. The spell also allows the subject to breathe underwater.

##### PROPHYLAXIS
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 4

This spell provides an extra die per hit for a subject to resist infection, drugs, or toxins. The spell does not dis- criminate between harmful and beneficial drugs, so the subject also resists medicines and other helpful drugs while under its effects. Reduce the bonuses of a bene- ficial drug by 1 for every hit rolled in the casting; three or more hits block effects that do not have a bonus or penalty associated with them.

##### RESIST PAIN
Type: M Range: T Duration: P Drain: F – 4

Resist Pain allows the subject to ignore the pain of injuries, reducing penalties from Physical or Stun damage. Each hit on the Spellcasting Test removes the effect of one box of damage from each of the subject’s Condition Monitor tracks. It does not remove the damage itself; it only eliminates the modifiers. If all of the boxes on the track are filled, the character still falls unconscious.

The spell is permanent in that the boost to the pa- tient’s endorphin levels does not wear off. If the sub- ject’s damage rises above the level at which the patient is resisting pain or if the existing injuries heal, the spell dissipates. A person can only be under the effects of one Resist Pain spell at a time (the one with the most hits).

##### STABILIZE
Type: M Range: T Duration: P Drain: F – 4

When applied to a character with a filled Physical damage track, this spell stabilizes all vital functions and prevents the character from dying. The spell’s Force must equal or exceed the overflow damage already taken when the spell starts. The full time must be taken for the spell to become permanent before the character is truly stabilized; hits reduce the time it takes by 1 Combat Turn each. If successful, the spell prevents the character from taking further damage from Physical Damage Overflow (p. 209).

#### Illusion Spells
No matter how realistic they are, illusions cannot directly cause physical harm. They can cause distractions, loss of balance or orientation, and even symptoms like nausea or pain. All such effects vanish, though, as soon as the magician drops the illusion. Illusions can certainly cause harm by manipulating the senses so a victim walks into traffic or off a high building, for example, but they cannot directly cause damage.

Illusions fall into the following categories:
- **Obvious** illusions are used solely for entertainment and cannot fool subjects into believing they are real.
- **Realistic** illusions seem completely real. 
- **Single-sense illusions** affect only one sense. 
- **Multi-sense** illusions affect all senses.  
- **Mana** Illusions: Mana-based Illusion spells affect the mind and are ineffective against technological viewing systems like cameras. Mana illusions are resisted by [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG|Logic]] + [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]]. Some mana illusions affect the target’s senses directly; others affect the senses of anyone perceiving the subject of the spell (though you’re never affected by your own illusion spell). Though mana-based illusions can be created on the astral plane, their magical auras give them away as illusions to anyone who makes a successful [[Skill#ASSENSING INTUITION|Assensing]] Test—illusions can’t fool Assensing and cannot be used to disguise or create auras.
- **Physical** Illusions: Physical illusion spells create actual images or alter physical properties, such as light or sound. Physical illusions can be used on both living and technological systems. They are resisted by [[Attribute#INTUITION INT|Intuition]] + [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG|Logic]]; non-living devices resist with their Object Resistance. The magician must generate more hits than the observer for the illusion to be considered real. If the spell is not completely resisted, the target is fully affected by the illusion.

##### AGONY  
(REALISTIC, SINGLE-SENSE)
Type: M Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F – 4
##### MASS AGONY 
(REALISTIC, SINGLE-SENSE)
Type: M Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F – 2

A favorite of mages going through bad break-ups, Agony inflicts an illusion of terrible pain on the target. Each net hit scored by the magician temporarily inflicts 1 box of Physical and 1 box of Stun damage on the target. It is not actual damage, only a measure of the effect of the spell. The target is affected the same as if the damage were real, with the usual injury penalties. If the target’s damage boxes are completely filled, he is racked with pain, unable to move or act. Once the spell is ended, the pain and damage boxes immediately go away.

Agony affects a single target, while Mass Agony is an area spell.

##### BUGS  
(REALISTIC, MULTI-SENSE)
Type: M Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F – 3
##### SWARM  
(REALISTIC, MULTI-SENSE)
Type: M Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F – 1

These spells make the target believe that small bugs of various persuasions are crawling over their entire body, biting them, scurrying about, and crawling into as- sorted orifices. The bugs look, feel, smell, and even taste real. The illusion is usually enough to make any target who fails to resist freak out. For each net hit you get, the target loses 2 from their Initiative Score. If you sustain the spell, they lose the same amount from their Initiative Score at the beginning of each Combat Turn.

Bugs affects a single target, Swarm is an area spell.

##### CONFUSION  
(REALISTIC, MULTI-SENSE)
Type: M Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F – 3
##### MASS CONFUSION
(REALISTIC, MULTI-SENSE, AREA)
Type: M Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F - 1
##### CHAOS  
(REALISTIC, MULTI-SENSE)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F – 2
##### CHAOTIC WORLD  
(REALISTIC, MULTI-SENSE, AREA)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F

These spells produce a storm of conflicting sensations and images to confuse the senses. For each net hit on the Spellcasting Test, the target suffers a –1 dice pool modifier to all tests due to the distraction.

Confusion affects a single target. Mass Confusion is an area spell. The Chaos spell is a physical version of Confusion (above), so it also affects technological systems and sensing devices. Chaotic World is an area version of Chaos.

##### ENTERTAINMENT  
(OBVIOUS, MULTI-SENSE, AREA)
Type: M Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F – 3
##### TRID ENTERTAINMENT
(OBVIOUS, MULTI-SENSE, AREA)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F – 2

These area spells create obvious, but entertaining, illusions. Hits on the Spellcasting Test measure how detailed, interesting, and captivating the audience finds the illusion. The magician can reproduce just about anything from her imagination, or re-create something she has ex- perienced.

Entertainment affects the minds of the subjects and cannot be detected by non-living sensors. Trid Entertainment is a physical spell and can be perceived by both living subjects and non-living sensors.

These spells are used for amusement as well as art. The entertainment industry uses illusionists as literal special effects wizards. Magical designers and artists work to create new and interesting sensations, including sensations that can’t otherwise be experienced in the real world. Only the wealthy can afford the unique experiences offered by such magicians firsthand.

##### INVISIBILITY
(REALISTIC, SINGLE-SENSE)
Type: M Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F – 2
##### IMPROVED INVISIBILITY
(REALISTIC, SINGLE-SENSE)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F - 1

This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic, and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visible to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain undetected if she’s good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject’s surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.

##### MASK  
(REALISTIC, MULTI-SENSE)
Type: M Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 2
##### PHYSICAL MASK 
(REALISTIC, MULTI-SENSE)
Type: P Range: T Duration: S Drain: F – 1

The Mask spell requires the magician to touch the subject. The subject assumes a different physical appearance (of the same basic size and shape as her natural form) chosen by the magician. This spell can alter the subject’s voice, scent, and other physical character- istics as well.

Anyone who might see through the disguise must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Mask affects the minds of viewers. Physical Mask creates an illusion that affects technological sensors as well.

##### PHANTASM  
(REALISTIC, MULTI-SENSE, AREA)
Type: M Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F – 1
##### TRID PHANTASM  
(REALISTIC, MULTI-SENSE, AREA)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F

These area spells create convincing illusions of any object, creature, or scene the magician desires. They can create an illusion of anything the magician has seen before, from a flower or a credstick to a dragon breathing fire, as long as the illusion is no larger than the spell’s area of effect.

Anyone who might pierce the illusion must successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone attempting to resist at a later point.

Phantasm only affects living beings, while Trid Phantasm affects technological sensors as well.

##### HUSH  
(REALISTIC, SINGLE-SENSE, AREA)
Type: M Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F – 2
##### SILENCE  
(REALISTIC, SINGLE-SENSE, AREA)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F - 1

These spells create an area that dampens sound. Sonic attacks into or out of the field, as well as critter powers using a sonic medium (such as Paralyzing Howl), are reduced by –1 per hit on the Spellcasting Test. Anyone attempting to hear a sound from within or across the silenced area must successfully resist the spell.

Hush is a mana spell and so only affects living be- ings and magic sonic attacks. Silence affects technological devices and is useful for jamming alarms, detection devices, sonar, and tactical communications, as well as technological sonic weapons.

##### STEALTH  
(REALISTIC, SINGLE-SENSE)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F – 2

Stealth makes the subject less audible to normal and augmented hearing. The subject moves in silence, making less or no noise. Things not directly touched by the subject can still make noise, so a character under a Stealth spell would make no noise knocking on a door, but the door would make noise hitting the floor or wall if it was kicked in.

Anyone who might hear the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Make a single Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone who resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain unnoticed if her Sneaking Tests are up to par.

#### Manipulation Spells
Manipulation spells control, animate, or transform matter and energy. There are a number of keywords for manipulation spells.
- **Damaging**: Manipulation spells that cause damage have a Damage Value equal to their Force (unaltered by hits on the Spellcasting test) and 0 AP. The damage is resisted with [[Attribute#BODY BOD|Body]] + [[Armor]].
- **Mental**: Targets resist these spells with [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG|Logic]] + [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]]. Keep track of your net hits, as they determine how long you can sustain the spell. While the spell is sustained, the target may take a Complex Action on their turn to resist by making a [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG|Logic]] + [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]] Test with a dice pool penalty equal to the spell’s Force; every hit the target gets reduces the caster’s net hits by 1. The one being controlled can take this action even if they wouldn’t get an action because of the spell. The spell ends when your net hits are reduced to zero.
	- A victim of mental manipulation spell may roll to notice the magical effect according to the usual rules for [[Magic#Magic Perception|Perceiving Magic]] (p. 280). Some of the less subtle mental spells (Control Actions) are pretty obvious, but more subtle spells (like Control Thoughts) can be pretty insidious.
- **Environmental**: These spells don’t really have a target, and they don’t really affect targets directly. They just affect an area.
- **Physical**: These spells affect physical forms and are usually defended against with a living target’s [[Attribute#BODY BOD|Body]] + [[Attribute#STRENGTH STR|Strength]] or an inanimate object’s Object Resistance dice pool.

##### ANIMATE 
(PHYSICAL)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F - 1
##### MASS ANIMATE
(PHYSICAL, AREA)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F + 1

This spell causes inanimate objects to move. The object moves according to its structure (balls can roll, rugs may crawl, humanoid statues can walk, and so on). The spell imparts a limited flexibility, allowing solid objects such as statues to shamble a bit as if they had joints. You need to get net successes against the target’s Object Resistance (p. 295); larger items (over 200 kilograms) have their re- sistance increased by 2 for every full 200 kilos they weigh. Controlling the object takes only a Simple Action; objects can also be ordered to maintain their movement while you direct your attention elsewhere. You only have rough control over the object’s movement and can’t manipulate individual parts or components (finer control requires a spell like Magic Fingers, p. 294). The maximum movement rate for objects is (Force) meters per turn, subject to the gamemaster’s discretion. If the object is held by someone else, you need to win an Opposed Test using Force x 2 against the holder’s Strength + Body to break the object free. If it’s fastened, make this Force x 2 Success Test against an ap- propriate gamemaster-determined threshold.

Animate affects a single non-living object; Mass Animate is an area spell that can get a number of objects moving at once (like a room full of brooms, for example).

##### ARMOR
(PHYSICAL)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F - 2

This spell creates a glowing field of magical energy around the subject that protects against Physical Dam- age. It provides Armor equal to the hits scored and is cumulative with other armor. It is not included in any cal- culations to determine armor encumbrance (see Armor and Encumbrance, p. 169).

##### CONTROL ACTIONS
(MENTAL)
Type: M Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F – 1
##### MOB CONTROL 
(MENTAL, AREA)
Type: M Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F + 1

You control the physical actions of your target like a puppeteer pulling strings. The victim’s consciousness is unaffected, but you control the victim’s body. Use your own skills when forcing your target to perform actions. It takes a Complex Action to make the target perform any action.

Control Actions only affects a single target, Mob Control affects any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of Mob Control may be manipulated in- dividually (with separate actions) or issued the same command as a group (with a single action).

##### CONTROL THOUGHTS
(MENTAL)
Type: M Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F – 1
##### MOB MIND
(MENTAL, AREA)
Type: M Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F + 1

The magician seizes control of the target’s mind, di- recting everything the target thinks. The magician mentally gives commands with a Standard Action, and the target is compelled to obey as if it were his own idea.

Control Thoughts affects a single target, while Mob Mind affects any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of a Mob Mind may be manipulated individually (with separate actions) or issued the same command as a group (with a single action).

##### FLING  
(PHYSICAL, DAMAGING)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: I Drain: F – 2

This spell psychokinetically hurls a single object of no more than (Force) kilograms at a designated target. Use your Spellcasting Test in place of a normal Ranged Combat Test for the purposes of the item hitting the target, and use your Magic instead of Strength for de- termining Damage Value and range. Use standard grenade ranges (see Range Table, p. 185)

##### ICE SHEET
(ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: I Drain: F

This spell creates a slippery sheet of ice over the area of effect. Characters crossing the ice must make an Agility + Reaction Test with a threshold equal to the hits you score to avoid falling prone. Vehicles must make an immediate Crash Test (p. 201). The sheet melts at a rate of 1 square meter per minute at room temperature (faster when it’s hotter, slower when it’s colder, or not at all if it’s below freezing).

##### IGNITE 
(PHYSICAL)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: P Drain: F - 1

The Ignite spell accelerates molecular motion in the target, causing it to catch fire once the spell be- comes permanent. Against non-living targets, the magician must succeed against the target’s Object Resistance dice pool. Once the target ignites, it burns normally until it is consumed or extinguished.

Against living targets, treat Ignite as a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] v. Body + Reaction Test. If successful, the spell wraps a living target in heat and flames, eventually setting the target on fire (Fire Damage p. 171).

##### INFLUENCE 
(MENTAL)
Type: M Range: LOS Duration: P Drain: F – 1

You implant a single suggestion in the victim’s mind, like a powerful post-hypnotic command. For example, you might have your target think that FizzyFluid is the best drink on the market, or that he can’t remember his best friend’s name, or that he should let you past a locked door. The target carries out this suggestion as if it were his own idea. If confronted with the wrongness of the suggestion (like when the reality of the flavor of FizzyFluid in his mouth contrasts with his belief that it’s good), the subject can attempt to overcome it using the rules for overcoming mental manipulations (p. 292). In any case, the suggestion fades naturally after a number of minutes equal to your net hits.

##### LEVITATE 
(PHYSICAL)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F – 2

Levitate allows you to telekinetically lift a person or object and move it around. You have to beat a threshold equal to the subject’s mass divided by 200 kilograms, rounded up. The subject of the spell can be moved anywhere in your line of sight at a movement rate equal to the spell’s Force in meters per Combat Turn.

If you’re trying to levitate an item held by a living being, or levitate an unwilling living being, that being can defend against the Spellcasting Test with Strength + Body. You can use this spell to levitate yourself, if you need a view from a higher perspective or desire some parachute-free sky diving.

##### LIGHT
(ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F – 4

This spell creates a mobile point of light, illuminating a radius around it equal to the spell’s Force in meters. The spell cannot be used to blind a target, but it offsets darkness visibility modifiers. Each hit on the Spellcasting Test counters a –1 die penalty due to light conditions.

##### MAGIC FINGERS 
(PHYSICAL)
Type: P Range: LOS Duration: S Drain: F – 2

Magic Fingers creates a psychokinetic effect as a sort of invisible hand that can hold or manipulate items. The hits on the Spellcasting + Magic Test become the spell’s effective Strength and Agility. You can use skills remotely with Magic Fingers, replacing your inherent limits with the spell’s Force. The spell has problems with fine control, so even simple actions such as picking up a coin may require a test (at the gamemaster’s discretion). You can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action, using the magic fingers as if they were your real hands. The magic fingers can manipulate objects within your line of sight, but only objects within a meter or so of one another at any giv- en moment (the “hands” can’t be farther away from each other than your arm span). This spell comes in very handy (no pun intended) for disarming bombs and handling oth- er hazardous work from a safe distance.

##### MANA BARRIER
(ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA)
Type: M Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F – 2

Mana Barrier creates an invisible barrier of magical energy. It has a barrier rating equal to the net hits scored and follows the rules for mana barriers (p. 315). This barrier does not restrict living beings or physical objects, but it impedes spirits, foci, dual beings, and spells on the plane in which you cast it (physical or astral). If cast on the astral plane, it also impedes astral forms and reduces visibility.

##### PHYSICAL BARRIER
(ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F - 1

This spell creates a glowing, translucent force field with 1 point of both Armor and Structure rating per hit. You can form the barrier as a dome with a radius and height equal to the spell’s normal radius. Alternately, you can use it to form a wall with a height equal to the spell’s Force and a length equal to its Force x 2.

Physical Barrier creates a physical wall. Anything the size of a molecule (or less) can pass through the barrier, including air or other gases. Anything bigger treats the barrier as a normal physical wall. The wall is translucent but shimmers, the equivalent of Light Fog (p. 175). The barrier does not impede spellcasting (other than visibility penal- ties), except for spells with physical components like in- direct combat spells. The barrier can be brought down by physical attacks, but as long as you sustain it will regenerate all of its Structure Rating at the beginning of each Com- bat Turn. If the barrier is reduced to Structure Rating 0, it collapses and the spell ends.

##### POLTERGEIST
(ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F - 2

Poltergeist picks up all small objects (up to a kilogram in mass) within the spell’s area and whirls them around in random patterns. This creates the equivalent visibility penalty of Light Fog (p. 175). The spell inflicts 2 boxes of Stun damage (resisted with Body + Armor) to anyone in the area each Combat Turn, whacking them with flying debris. Poltergeist may do more damage in cluttered en- vironments, or inflict Physical damage if the gamemaster feels the debris is sufficiently dangerous (broken glass and nails, for example). If there is no debris lying around, this spell doesn’t do much more than make a spooky noise.

##### SHADOW 
(ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA)
Type: P Range: LOS (A) Duration: S Drain: F – 3

Shadow creates a globe of darkness with a radius equal to the spell’s Force in meters. For every two hits, increase the light penalty (p. 175) by one catagory—2 hits for Partial Light, 4 hits for Dim Light, and 6 hits for Total Darkness. This spell doesn’t cause more than Total Darkness.
