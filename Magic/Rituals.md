These are the rituals you can learn and cast. You learn each ritual the same way you learn a spell (p. 299). Some rituals have keywords, which have special rules, just like the keywords for spells.

**Anchored**: All anchored rituals must be placed on a physical object or symbol of mystical significance that serves as the ritual’s focal point. This could be something used specifically for the ritual (a rock or a doorway to anchor a ward, for example), or a mystical inscription (written in ink, paint, blood, etch marks, etc.), or even the foundation itself. The anchor cannot be moved relative to the Gaiasphere (the planet) during the duration of the ritual’s effect, or the ritual collapses and the effect ends early.

**Material Link**: The ritual requires a material link to the target, something that was once a part of the target. Material links from living beings aren’t usable in rituals forever—the Material Links sidebar (p. 297) has all the details.

**Minion**: The ritual creates a semi-autonomous entity, usually something to help the magician who makes it. Whatever minion is created is bound to the ritual leader, who can’t have more minions at a time than his Charisma rating.

**Spell**: This ritual is used in conjunction with a spell that the ritual leader knows. Some of its properties might change—the ritual has details on how. If the leader has any modifiers to the spell from a mentor spirit, the modifiers apply to the ritual, too. These rituals are susceptible to dispelling (p. 295).

**Spotter**: If the ritual’s target is not in sight of the leader, the leader needs to designate someone who can see the target for them, referred to as the spotter. The individual acting as the spotter must be a member of the group casting the ritual—or a spirit bound to a member of that group—and must be able to astrally perceive the target. The spotter must be present in the ritual’s foundation when the ritual begins and then must travel physically or astrally to where she can assense the target of the spell; this is an exception to the “no leaving” rule in Step 4 of [[Magic#Ritual Spellcasting|Ritual Casting]]. The target does not have to be astrally active (and it’s often safer for the spotter if he isn’t); the spotter merely must be able to assense him to establish the necessary mystic link. If the spell is an area spell, the spotter must be able to assense the target location. For the duration of the ritual, a link is present between the spotter’s astral form and the ritual group. If the spotter is noticed by the target, it is possible to use the link to track her back to the ritual team’s physical location. The spotter doesn’t make a Teamwork Test with the rest of the participants but still suffers the same Drain as everyone else.

### CURSE  
(MATERIAL LINK, SPELL) or 
A Curse allows an illusion spell to be cast on a subject through a material link rather than a mystic link from observing the subject. A Curse can be used on any target, whether within visual range of the leader or not, provided there is a link to the target. If the spell ap- plies to multiple targets, such as in a mass spell, then the ritual must have a link to each of the targets.

The link is used as part of the offering and is effectively destroyed during the ritual. The spell is cast normally (using teamwork, if applicable) with all the tests and Drain appropriate to the chosen illusion spell (step 6 of Ritual Spellcasting).

For the duration of the ritual, a link is present between the target and the ritual group while the spell portion is sustained. It is possible to spot the link and use it to track back to the ritual team’s physical location.

This ritual requires (Force) hours to complete.

### PRODIGAL SPELL 
(SPELL, SPOTTER)
This ritual allows you to cast any Combat spell at a discount tant target that is out of line of sight of your ritual team. The Combat spell can be either direct or indirect. Direct combat spells travel to the target in astral space. India rect combat spells travel to the target in physical space, requiring a clear (but not necessarily straight) path in the physical world between the ritual team and target in order for the spell to reach its destination—the spell flies from the foundation to the target, dodging any ob-anystacles in its path.

This ritual requires (Force) hours to perform.

### REMOTE SENSING
(SPELL, SPOTTER)
This ritual allows you to cast any Detection spell with an even greater range. The area of the spell is increased to Force x (sum total of the participants’ Magic attributes) x 100 meters. The spell’s subject must be present in the foundation during the ritual but may then take his new sense outside the foundation while the ritual participants sustain it for him. All of the participants of the ritual perceive the same thing the subject perceives through the spell. If the spell has a target (like when you use a Mind Link or a Mind Probe spell in the ritual), you’ll need a spotter to have eyes on the target.

This ritual takes (Force) hours to perform. Afterward, if any of the participants stops sustaining the ritual, it ends.

### WARD 
(ANCHORED)
The ward is a basic ritual, taught to many magicians. It creates an [[Spells#MANA BARRIER|astral barrier]] with a Force equal to the Force of the ritual. The ward may encompass a volume of up to fifty cubic meters times the sum of the participants’ Magic ratings.

This ritual takes (Force) hours to complete. The ward lasts for a number of weeks equal to the net hits from the sealing step of the ritual—if the leader spends an amount of karma equal to the ward’s Force, the ward is permanent.

### CIRCLE OF PROTECTION
(ANCHORED)
The circle of protection is a small astral and physical barrier. Even though it’s called a circle, it creates a sphere around the anchor that has a radius in meters equal to the leader’s Magic rating. The circle acts as a combination of the physical barrier and mana barrier spells (p. 315) with a Force equal to the Force of the ritual. The mana barrier is dual-natured.

The ward lasts for a number of hours equal to the net hits from the sealing step. Anyone or anything within the barrier is protected from outside physical objects and magical attacks. If something crosses the barrier from the inside, then the ward ends. This ritual takes (Force) hours to perform.

### CIRCLE OF HEALING 
(ANCHORED, SPELL)
This ritual is used to cast a healing magic on a number of targets at once. Even though it’s called a circle, it creates a sphere around the anchor that has a radius in meters equal to the leader’s Magic rating. This ritual takes (Force) hours to complete. The net hits from the sealing step are used as the net hits for the spell, and apply to everyone in the circle as long as they remain in the circle. The circle lasts for (Force) days.

### RENASCENCE 
(ANCHORED, SPELL)
This ritual sustains and maintains an area manipulation spell for a time. The area of the spell is a sphere with a radius equal to the leader’s Magic rating, and the effect is based on the ritual’s Force and the net hits from the sealing step. The base duration of the effect is 1 hour, which is doubled for each net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

This ritual takes (Force) hours to perform.

### WATCHER 
(MINION)
Watchers are like spirits, but in actuality are entities born from the ritual leader’s own mind rather than the metaplanes. They are a creation of mana, woven with the personalities of the ritual participants. A watcher can speak any language its creators (which includes the leader and participants) can speak. A watcher is bound only to the leader of the ritual and follows his orders. A watcher lasts for a number of hours equal to its Force times the net hits on the sealing test. A watcher’s skills are equal to half the Force of the ritual (rounded up).

A leader can dismiss a watcher bound to him as a Free Action. Watchers cannot be banished or counterspelled. This ritual takes (Force) minutes to perform.

### HOMUNCULUS 
(MINION)
The magician can bind a spark of intelligence into an in- animate form, creating a homunculus. The homunculus has a physical form but isn’t very bright. It understands any language its creators (leader and participants) speak and has a modicum of a personality that reflects those of its creators.

You need an inanimate object to animate for the ritual. Despite the fact that their name means “little man,” the homunculus doesn’t need to be humanoid in shape— animal statuettes are pretty common among shamans, and don’t underestimate the usefulness of an animated extension cord. It can be at most (Force x 10) kilograms in mass, and it gains a limited amount of flexibility (the same as the Animate spell, p. 292) for the duration of the ritu- al. Whatever you use, the object’s Object Resistance dice pool is added to the opposition for the leader’s and par- ticipants’ Ritual Spellcasting Test, which is why you don’t see many homunculus commlinks.

The homunculus obeys the leader’s commands as much as possible within the limitations of its physical capabilities. Commanding a homunculus is not like commanding a spirit. A spirit is intuitive and intelligent; a homunculus just follows orders and becomes frustrated when the task becomes impossible. A homunculus lasts for a number of days equal to its Force times the net hits on the sealing test. A watcher’s skills are equal to half the Force of the ritual (rounded up).

This ritual takes (Force) hours to perform.
