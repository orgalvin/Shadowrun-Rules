Mana barriers are magical walls that impede or block magic and astral forms. Mana barriers can be on the physical or astral planes, but some are dual-natured barriers that exist on both. The Mana Barriers table lists the different ways to create a mana barrier contained in this book.

Mana barriers on the physical plane are invisible (except to astral perception), but they act as solid barriers to spells, manifesting entities, spirits, and active foci. Anybody trying to cast a spell through a barrier must contend with the Force of the barrier, which is added to the Defense or the Resistance dice pool. If the spell doesn’t normally have an opposed dice pool, the Spellcasting test becomes an Opposed Test against the Force of the barrier.

Mana barriers on the astral plane are solid, hazily opaque walls. Such barriers stop astral movement and impose a visual penalty equal to the barrier’s Force. Astral mana barriers are resistant to astral spells as well as other astral forms, in the same manner as physical mana barriers.

Dual-natured mana barriers are active on both planes simultaneously, and they act like mana barriers on both planes at once.

Adept powers and many always-on critter powers are innate and so are unaffected by a barrier. The gamemaster has the option to have certain ranged and sustained critter powers (such as Concealment or Movement) suffer the same fate as spells.

Mana barriers do not affect their creators, who can see through them or pass through them at will and allow others to do so as well.

### GETTING AROUND MANA BARRIERS
If you’ve got a mana barrier in your way, you’ve got a couple options other than “give up.” You can try breaking through violently, or you can try passing through subtly.

If you want to break through a mana barrier, you need to deal with its Armor and Structure Ratings, just as you would with any other barrier. A mana barrier has Armor and Structure ratings equal to its Force. Break it quickly, because they regain their full Structure at the end of every Combat Turn. The creator of a mana barrier is instantly aware of any attack on the barrier.

Awakened characters have discovered other methods of forcing their way through an astral barrier besides the use of brute force. You can press through a barrier with a Magic + Charisma [Astral] v. barrier’s Force x 2 Opposed Test. If you get any net hits, you pass through the barrier and emerge on the other side. You can bring a number of friends, spirits, active foci, sustained spells, or other astral forms with you, one for each net hit you score. If the barrier scores more hits, you fail to break through.

##### ASTRAL INTERSECTIONS
Mana barriers and astral forms are often tied to physical objects. Astral beings can’t push physical objects around, so objects may get dragged into contact with barriers or (rarely) other astral constructs. For example, a van protected with a mana barrier can drive into a warded garage, an astrally perceiving magician can ride an elevator into a warded basement, or a spell focus amulet could be placed inside a spirit focus box.

If this happens, each astral form makes an Opposed Test: living beings a Magic + Charisma, and non-living barriers and objects a Force x 2 test. The participant with any net hits remains normal and intact, while all others are disrupted—on a tie, all participants are dis- rupted.

Disruption means different consequences for different things. Disrupted spells and rituals end, disrupted preparations lose their spell and become mundane, disrupted mana barriers collapse, disrupted foci deactivate, disrupted spirits are banished, and disrupted living creatures are knocked unconscious with a full Stun Condition Monitor. Any permanent mana barrier that is disrupted regains all its Structure at the end of the Combat Turn.
