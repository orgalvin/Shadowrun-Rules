### Summoning
1. Choose Spirit type and Force
	- Choose a type of spirit available to your tradition, and the Force up to Magic Rating x2
	- Spirits have optional powers for every 3 points of force
2. Attempt Summoning
	- opposed [[Skill#SUMMONING MAGIC|Summoning]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] [Force] vs spirit's Force
	- provides one [[#Spirit Service]] per net hit
3. Resist Drain
	- Drain Value is equal to twice the hits (not net hits) on the spirit's defense test, minimum 2. If the spirit's force is greater than your Magic rating, the Drain is physical

**Glitches**: A glitch can result in the wrong spirit type, a spirit of lesser force, or extra drain. On a critical glitch, kindhearted gamesmasters can double the Drain or not allow the drain to be resisted. More evil gamemasters mah introduce the magician to a spirit of the intended Force who is not under the summoner's control.
