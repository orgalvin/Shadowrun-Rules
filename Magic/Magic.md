### Force
Almost everything magical has a force. This attribute is a measure of magical power, and is used as a limit for magical effects performed without the channeling benefits of reagents or foci.

### Inherent Limit: Astral
Equal to Mental or Social [[Derived Calculations#Inherent Limits|Limit]], whichever is greater

### Drain
Magical Actions that cause Drain have a Drain Value. The base Drain Value for Sorcery or Enchanting tests is listed with the spell, ritual, or preparation description. For Conjuring tests, the Drain Value is twice the hits (not net hits) generated by the spirit when it resists the Conjuring atempt. Drain is generally inflicted as Stun damage, though there are exceptions. You resist the damage from Drain through a Drain Resistance Test, with each hit reducing the Drain by one. **Drain Damage cannot be healed.**

### Power Points (Adept)
Power Points are the qi energy that adepts can spend to buy permanent powers. You can get a free power point whenever you increase your [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic Attribute]], or through initiation instead of gaining a metamagic.

### Lodges
A lodge is a place where a spellcaster can record lore, expand their talent, and practice magic. It is a basic tool for casters that is required to learn spells and craft foci, but can also be used for protection from magical threats.
- Acts as a mana barrier and shares your magical signature

### Magic Perception
Noticing magic or casting is a [[Skill#PERCEPTION INTUITION|Perception]] + [[Attribute#INTUITION INT|Intuition]] [Mental] test with a threshold of Skill Rating of the practitioner minus the Force of the magic, or 6 - Force if there is no skill involved.

### Spellcasting
1. Choose [[Spells]]
	- Some magicitions can cast multiple spells simultaneously. To do this you have to split your [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] dice pool between the spells you wish to cast, minimum 1 per spell. Since spell modifiers may be different, thy are applied after the split. The number of spells that can be cast simultaneously is limited to your [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]]
2. Choose target
	- You must be able to see or touch the target to establish the link. The sightline must be physical, not digital.
	- If in the physical world can only target physical targets, if in astral world can only target astral targets. If using astral perception, can cast on either plane
		- Only mana-based spells work in astral space
	- **Area Spells** AOE is a sphere centered on the target or location with a radius in meters equal to the [[#Force]] of the spell
3. Choose Force
	- The force acts as the limit on the spell, with a force up to [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] x 2
	- If the number of hits (not net hits) you get _after applying the limit_ exceeds your [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] rating, the Drain is Physical instead of Stun damage
4. Cast Spell
	- Make a [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] [Force] Test, including dice pool modifiers for injury, sustained spells, etc. Any opposition roll or threshold is listed in the spell description.
	- **Reckless Spellcasting:** You cast a spell as a simple action instead of a complex, but with a +3 drain value (per spell if multicasting)
5. Determine Effect
	- Combat Spells
		- **Direct:** Deals damage equal to net hits. [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] [Force] vs either [[Attribute#BODY BOD|Body]] for physical spells or [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]] for mana spells
		- **Indirect:** Originates near the magicians body, and then launched with an opposed [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] [Force] vs [[Attribute#REACTION REA|Reaction]] + [[Attribute#INTUITION INT|Intuition]]. Damage Value is Force + net hits, with an AP of -Force. Damage is resisted with [[Attribute#BODY BOD|Body]] + [[Armor]]
		- **Indirect Area:** Functions like a grenade, [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]] [Force] (3) with Scatter of 2d6 meters. Net hits are added to the Damage value, but only if the threshold is met; otherwise the spell goes off but the net hits are used to reduce scatter by one meter per hit.
	- Detection Spells
		- **Active:** Opposed [[Skill#SPELLCASTING MAGIC|Spellcasting]] + [[Attribute#MAGIC MAG|Magic]][Force]
1. Resist Drain
	- Drain Value never lower than 2
	- Shaman resists with [[Attribute#CHARISMA CHA|Charisma]] + [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]]
	- Hermetic Mage resists with [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG|Logic]] + [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]]
2. Determine Ongoing effects
	- If you want the effect of a sustained spell to continue, you take a -2 dice pool penalty to all tests while it is sustained, per spell you are sustaining.
	- AOE sustained spells can be moed as a complex action, following the targeting rules

Glitches
A glitch on a spell might cause extra drain (typically +2), invoke a different elemental effect than intended, hit the wrong target, or anything else the GM can think of. On a critical glitch the spell could get away from you and cause all sorts of havoc, or you might not get to resist Drain, or it could go off in an unconventional or unpredictable manner, up to the GM.
