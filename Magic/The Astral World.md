### AURAS & ASTRAL FORMS
Living things in general are not active on the astral plane but still cast a reflection of themselves there. This reflection is called an aura; it appears as a shining, vibrant, colorful luminescence. Any non-living objects appear as faded semblances of their physical selves; grey, lifeless, and intangible.

Anything active on the astral plane, including spirits, active foci, dual-natured beings, etc., has a tangible astral form. These forms are more colorful and brighter than auras, as they are astrally “real.” The Earth has an astral form, and many regard this as proof that the planet as a whole is a living entity apart from (or made up of) the creatures that inhabit its surface.

### ASTRAL SIGNATURE
Generally, when magicians cast a spell or perform a ritual, they leave their astral fingerprints on it. This is called an astral signature, and it’s produced on any- thing affected by magic skills or abilities. This astral signature can be detected by anyone with the [[Skill#ASSENSING INTUITION|Assensing]] skill. A signature lasts for a number of hours equal to the magical effect’s Force after the effect (spell, critter power, astral battle, or whatever it was) ends, slowly fading into the background. An astral signature of a spell can be detected both where it was cast and where it took effect. Semi-permanent objects such as alchemical preparations and watchers contain an astral signature while they last. More permanent items such as foci, lodges, and circles always contain the astral signature of their owner.

A character can attempt to read an astral signature with an [[Skill#ASSENSING INTUITION|Assensing]] + [[Attribute#INTUITION INT|Intuition]] [Astral] test. This is not the simplest task, as perceiving and understanding an astral signature is somewhat difficult amid the mixture of magic and emotional background of the astral plane. Once successfully read, a signature can be recognized again (possibly with a Memory Test, p. 152). Other details such as the general class of spell or spirit, or the skill of the magician, can be determined with net hits (see Assensing p. 142).

A magician using astral perception can “wipe clean” a temporary astral signature (such as from sorcery) or hasten its normal fading. A magician can spend a Com- plex Action to reduce the amount of time it takes for the signature to fade by 1 hour (mentally pushing the signature into the background energy, if you will). No test is required. This action can be done multiple times until the astral signature is gone. If the signature is not completely erased, it will be obvious to others assensing it that someone tampered with it.

Magical forensic investigators use astral signatures to gather information about criminal magicians, so be care- ful about leaving them behind where they are likely seen.

### ASTRAL PERCEPTION
Many Awakened characters can perceive the astral plane from the physical world. This ability is called astral perception. It is a primary sense used in the astral plane that allows you to “see” auras and other things in the astral world overlaid on the material plane. Astral perception is available only to some; for metahumans you can only use astral perception if you’re a magician, or an adept with the Astral Perception power. Technically, astral perception isn’t vision—you don’t need working eyes to see in the astral plane—but vision is the easiest metaphor to use.

With the skill of Assensing, you can interpret the “colors” and “brightness” of an aura to determine the wellness and state of being of the subject. When astrally perceiving, you become dual-natured (meaning you have presence in both the physical and astral planes simultaneous- ly) and can interact with astral objects, including through combat. Astrally perceiving while trying to accomplish mundane tasks is very distracting; you take a –2 dice pool penalty to actions on the physical plane.

While astral perception allows an Awakened character to sense the astral plane, actually interpreting what you’re looking at takes practice. Interpreting auras to gain information about the person or thing to which they belong is called Assensing. If you want to learn more about an aura, you may make a Simple [[Skill#ASSENSING INTUITION|Assensing]] + [[Attribute#INTUITION INT|Intuition]] [Astral] Test, with the number of hits determining how much you learn (details are on the [[Assensing Table.png]]). Without attempting to read an aura, you can still get an impression of what type of aura it is (spell, ritual, spirit, living creature, foreboding horror from beyond all mortal ken, etc.).

Like physical perception, you don’t need to make a test to see things that are immediately obvious (and since astral forms are bright and vibrant, this means that most astral forms are easy to spot). You only need to roll the dice when your target is trying to hide or when you’re trying to observe in detail—then you make an Assensing Test to see what you can see.

Objects that are neither magical nor living do not have an aura; they are featureless grey shadows of their phys- ical form. They can, however, pick up impressions for a limited time from being in contact with living auras. A teddy bear in the Barrens might pick up a child’s fear, a wedding ring its owner’s sense of love and joy, or a murder weapon an aura of rage. These impressions are vague and fleeting, but you don’t need to assense the object to get them. Note that it’s the object that picks up the impression—a trid display used at an oppressive desk job would give the sense of stress, even if it was displaying a love note.

### ASTRAL PROJECTION
If astral perception is like sticking your face in a lake to peer below the surface, astral projection is diving right in. Your consciousness is contained in an astral form and can leave your corporeal body. Your astral form is a mental projection of your self image combined with physical characteristics based on your mental attributes, which means you can always have awesome hair.

A projecting mage can travel around the astral plane at great speeds unimpeded by material objects such as walls, floors, and burly goons (unless they are dual-natured). Your body is in a coma-like state while your astral body is out in the aether. Your mind and body are still connected, so any damage taken to body or mind is felt by both. Only characters who are full Magicians can astrally project.

You’re using astral perception the entire time you’re projecting, so you can see the auras of living things. Auras alone don’t give you the mystic link you need to target spells. As the saying goes, what’s cast in astral space stays in astral space, and ditto for physical space.

If your body is moved away from where the magician expects it to be, they must make an Assensing + Intution [Astral] (1 hour) Extended test with a threshold determined by the GM (Based on distance and how well it is hidden).

#### ASTRAL MOVEMENT
Astral forms can move almost at the speed of thought. The magician only needs to imagine himself at a place and his astral body travels there. Any nearby places can be reached in seconds, minutes for locations on the same continent, hours to get anywhere on the globe. At this speed however, you have no time to perceive the environment, and things you pass are a blur (think warp speed in movies). Astral barriers block astral travel, and you might run into one before you realize that it’s in your way.

If you’re looking for a particular place or thing, you must travel at a slower pace. “Slower” in this case means up to 100 meters each Combat Turn—this is considered to be the Walking rate in astral space. Moving faster, 5 kilometers per Combat Turn, is your Running rate—the normal penalties to actions for Running apply in these cases.

Astral forms can move in any direction—they are not limited by gravity as they are in the physical world, though most projecting magicians tend to stick close to the ground because that’s where most of the interesting stuff is, if not out of force of habit. The exception to this freedom of movement is at the limits of the Earthly atmosphere (about eighty kilometers up)—the Gaiasphere weakens to the point where astral voyagers usually go mad or die.

Only astral forms can slow or affect another astral form. The Earth is solid on the astral plane, just as it is in the physical world; astral forms cannot pass through it. Secure facilities are often built underground to keep out astral intruders. Active weapon foci have a presence in astral space and can harm an astral form (see Foci, p. 318), but you must be present on the astral plane to use the focus in astral combat. Only mana spells affect astral forms.

#### MANIFESTING
A purely astral form such as a spirit or an astrally projecting magician can interact with the physical plane by manifesting. Manifesting is a psychic effect that lets you make yourself visible and audible on the physical plane through an act of will. Manifesting takes a Com- plex Action to engage or disengage. You appear on the physical plane as a ghostly, hazy image of your astral form and may freely communicate with physical characters. Unlike the Materialization power of spirits (p. 314), manifesting doesn’t give you a physical form, so you can’t interact with anything physically (or be harmed by physical attacks). It’s a psychic connection, so you can’t cast spells on targets on the physical plane while you’re manifesting. For the same reason, technological devices can’t detect or record you. You’re still on the astral plane, so astral attacks can still target you. Manifesting is pretty taxing, so you can only manifest for a total of your Magic Rating x 5 minutes per astral projection session.

#### STAYING ASTRAL
It’s mentally taxing to stay on the astral plane for a long time. You can use astral projection for a number of hours equal to your Magic Rating x 2. If you stay out longer, your astral being ceases to exist and your body dies. This might make spotting rituals more difficult to complete (the time limit, that is—death makes everything more complex). If you return to your body, this clock stops, but it doesn’t reset until you’ve spent at least as long in your body as you spent out of it.

### ASTRAL DETECTION
Physical beings may sense when an astral form passes through their aura. Make a Perception + Intuition (4) [Mental] Test—you receive a +2 dice pool bonus if you’re Awakened. If the test is successful, the character feels slightly breathless, and they experience a chill or tingling sensation from the passing of the astral form. Security personnel are trained to recognize this feeling as a sign of an astral intruder. This specialization of Perception is called Numinous Perception, which includes both the chilly tingle of astral forms and the “bad vibes” of noticing magic (p. 280).

### ASTRAL COMBAT
Astral combat is resolved in the same way as physical combat. Astrally perceiving and dual-natured charac- ters use their physical attributes and skills to fight op- ponents with a physical body, and their Astral Combat + Willpower to fight wholly astral entities. Astrally projecting characters use their mental attributes in place of physical ones (see Astral Attributes Table) along with the Astral Combat skill. There are no ranged weapons that function in astral space, so unarmed attacks, active weapon foci, and mana spells are the only options for astral combat.

Unarmed astral attacks are an performed through an Opposed Astral Combat + Willpower [Astral] v. Intuition + Logic Test. Astral attacks with a weapon focus are an Opposed Astral Combat + Willpower [Accuracy] v. Intuition + Logic Test. Base Damage Values are listed on the Astral Damage Table; add 1 to the DV per net hit on an attack. Damage inflicted from astral combat can be either Stun or Physical (attacker’s choice). Astral barriers can only be affected by Physical damage.

### ASTRAL TRACKING
Nearly all magical things (spirits, spells, foci, and magical lodges) have an astral link to whoever was responsible for them. Active spells are linked to their casters, spirits are linked to their summoners, astrally projecting magicians are linked to their physical bodies, and foci and magical lodges are linked to the magicians who activated them. Awakened entities who assense the astral signature of these astral forms can track their links through the astral plane back to their sources. Following an astral link requires an Assensing + Intuition (5, 1 hour) [Astral] Extended Test modified as noted on the Astral Tracking Modifiers table.
