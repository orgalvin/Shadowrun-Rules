Since the advent of AR mapping, a walk through the
sprawl never requires a test, but getting from A to B
can be a lot tougher when the Matrix isn’t pointing the
way. Navigation tests are required when you’re traversing
unmarked or highly unfamiliar terrain, such as
someone new to Seattle attempting to navigate the
Ork Underground. It’s a Simple Navigation + Intuition
[Mental] Test, with a threshold based on the terrain,
taking into account modifiers for environmental factors
such as poor visibility, landmarks, existing trails, advice
from locals, and so on—your gamemaster will give you
a threshold based on the Success Test Thresholds table
on p. 45.
