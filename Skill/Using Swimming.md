[[Skill]]

Swimming is a Complex Action. A swimming character
can move a number of meters in a Combat Turn equal to
the average of their Agility and Strength. You can take
a Simple Action to “sprint” with a Swimming + Strength
[Physical] Test, adding 1 meter per hit, or 2 meters per
hit if you’re an elf or a troll. Swimming on the surface
of water or under it does not affect this rate of speed.
As with the Running skill, swimmers suffer from fatigue
after an extended time (Fatigue Damage, p. 172).

##### HOLDING YOUR BREATH
Sixty seconds (twenty Combat Turns) is the base time
a character can hold his breath before any tests are
needed. A character needing to hold his breath longer
can make a Swimming + Willpower Test (with the
Controlled Hyperventilation specialization coming into
play if you have it). Each net hit extends the clock by 15
seconds (5 Combat Turns).
Once the time expires the character must breathe or
take 1 box of Stun damage at the end of each Combat
Turn until they breathe (this damage cannot be resisted).
Once all the stun boxes are filled, the character loses
consciousness. At this point the character takes one box
of physical damage at the end of each Combat Turn until
rescued or dead.

##### TREADING WATER
If you’re just trying to keep afloat, you can tread water.
You can tread water for a number of minutes equal to
your Strength rating. At the end of this time, make a
Simple Swimming + Strength [Physical] (2) Test. Success
means you can keep treading water (or float, if you’re
skilled at Swimming) for the same amount of time before
another test; failure means you slip and take 1 box
of Stun damage that you can’t resist. If you have a flotation
device, double the time between tests. You can
keep treading water as long as you can stay conscious.
