##### CLIMBING
The Gymnastics skill is applied to both assisted and unassisted
climbing tasks. Assisted climbing is accomplished
with specialized gear such as ropes and harnesses (see
p. 448). Assisted climbing is easier and safer, but requires
more preparation. Unassisted climbing may be
done on the fly, because you climb without any gear.
Climbing is a Complex Action, and the number of hits
you get on your Gymnastics + Strength [Physical] Test
determines how far you can move vertically or laterally
during your climb, as noted on the Climbing Table. The
more difficult the climb, the more dice pool modifiers
you get, which is also noted on the Climbing Table.

##### RAPPELLING
Rappelling is a gear-aided descent at near free-fall speed.
This technique requires a Free-Fall + Body [Physical] (2)
Success Test. So long as you have the proper gear and
training, you can brake at any point in the descent, slow
your speed, and land safely. Rappelling expends a Simple
Action, during which you fall at a rate of 20 meters
per Combat Turn. Rappelling characters can increase the
number of meters descended during that same Combat
Turn by 1 for each net hit beyond the threshold on the
Free-Fall Test. If you take another Simple Action in the
same phase, such as firing a weapon, you get a –2 dice
pool modifier to both that action and the Free-Fall Test.
Stopping requires another Free-Fall Test with the same
threshold. On an unsuccessful test, you don’t slow down
and may take damage if you hit the ground at speed
(Falling Damage, p. 172).

##### CLIMBING FAILURES AND GLITCHES
A test while climbing or rappelling automatically halts
your progress, and you have to make a Reaction +
Strength Test to hold on. If you fail this second test, you
start to fall (about 20 meters per Combat Turn). During
your next Action Phase, you may attempt to stop by
making a Reaction + Strength Test with a –2 dice pool
modifier. Your gamemaster may allow other climbers to
make a Reaction + Strength Test to grab you.
Characters who are using climbing gear are allowed
an additional test if they fall. Have the character who prepared
the safety lines make a Free-Fall + Logic [Mental]
Test against a threshold equal to half the falling character’s
Body (round down). The falling character may apply
Edge to this test. If successful, the safety gear catches,
leaving the character dangling. If it fails, the character
falls (see Falling Damage, p. 172).

##### JUMPING
Jumping is done from a running or standing position.
Running leaps get more distance than standing jumps
do, if you have enough room to get up to full speed.
Make a Gymnastics + Agility Test, applying any appropriate
modifiers. For every hit you get on this test, you
jump 1 meter on a standing jump or 2 meters for a running leap. No matter how many hits you get, you can’t
jump farther than your Agility x 1.5 meters (net hits beyond
this mean you did it with style).
For a vertical jump, it’s the same test, but you get half
a meter of altitude per hit and the maximum you can
jump is 1.5 times your height.
