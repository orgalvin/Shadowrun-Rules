[[Skill]]

The Leadership skill is about coaxing, convincing,
threatening, or challenging your subordinates, or getting
people to accept you as a superior. If you lead
people who accept you as their (lone) superior, even
temporarily, you can take a Complex Action to make a
Simple Leadership + Charisma [Social] Test. How this
helps depends on what you choose to do.
Command: The target resists with a Leadership +
Willpower [Mental] test (with Social Modifiers, p. 140).

For every net hit you get, the target accepts you as their leader for 1 Combat Turn. This doesn’t work if you’ve failed on this target before.

Direct: Your hits act as a Teamwork Test for one subordinate’s
skill or Composure Test that they perform on
or before their next Action Phase.

Inspire: Your hits act as a Teamwork Test for your subordinates’
Surprise Test for the rest of the Combat Turn.

Rally: Your subordinates add 1 to their Initiative
