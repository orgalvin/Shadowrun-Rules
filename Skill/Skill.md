Skill ratings levels are between 1 and 12 

Defaulting
Characters may attempt some skill-based tests even if they don’t have any ranks in the skill. This is known as defaulting. For example, even if you’re not trained in the art of running, you can still attempt a sprint to see just how much ground you can cover. In these instances, your dice pool for the test equals your ranking in the linked attribute – 1. So if Sorsha doesn’t have the Run- ning skill but wants to give a sprint a try, she’ll check her Strength, which is 6. That means she rolls 6 – 1 dice, or 5, and hopes for the best.

There are some skills, though, for which tests can- not default if you don’t have the appropriate skill—guts and a willingness to pitch in sometimes just aren’t a substitute for actual abilities. All the can-do spirit in the world won’t help you speak Russian if you don’t have any knowledge of the language, or repair a car if you’re not familiar with the basic workings of the machinery involved. It’s nice to be able to do everything, but sometimes you have to wait for an expert. Skills where defaulting is not an option are indicated in italics on the table on p. 151.

Skills are grouped into Active, Knowledge, and Language skills
- Active is what you do
- Knowledge is what you know
	- Linked to [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG]] and [[Attribute#INTUITION INT]]
	- four types: Academic, Interests, Professional, and Street
- Language is how you communicate

#### Knowledge Skills
##### STREET KNOWLEDGE
Street Knowledge is linked to Intuition. This type of
Knowledge skill is about knowing the movers and shakers
in an urban area, along with how things get done on
the street. You know about the people who live in different
neighborhoods, who to ask to get what, and where
things are. The information that these skills cover tends
to change rapidly, but your instincts help you keep up.

##### ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE
Academic knowledge is linked to Logic. This type of
knowledge includes university subjects such as history,
science, design, technology, magical theory, and the
people and organizations with fingers in those pies.
The humanities (cultures, art, philosophy, and so on)
are also included in this category.

##### PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE
Professional Knowledge skills deal with subjects related
to normal trades, professions, and occupations,
things like journalism, engineering, business, and so
on. You might find them helpful when doing legwork
for a run, especially those in the corporate world. All
Professional Knowledge skills are linked to Logic.

##### INTERESTS
Strange as it might sound, you might have some hobbies
outside of slinging mana and bullets. Interests are the
kind of Knowledge skill that describes what you know
because of what you do for fun. There are no guidelines
(and no limit) to the sort of interest skills you can have.
Interest Knowledge skills are linked to Intuition.

#### Attribute-Only Skills
##### COMPOSURE (CHA + WIL)
Some situations are tough to deal with, even for hardened professionals like shadowrunners. When a charge acter is faced with an emotionally overwhelming sit- uation there are only two choices. Stay and fight or turn into a quivering lump of goo. To find out which one happens, make a Willpower + Charisma Test, with a threshold based on the severity of the situation.Take note that repeating similar situations over and again eventually eliminates the need to perform this test. Staring down a group of well-armed gangers will be scary at first, but after a character does it a few times the fear gives way to instinct.

##### JUDGE INTENTIONS (CHA + INT)
Reading another person is also a matter of instinct. A character can use their instincts to guess at the intense tions of another person or to gauge how much they can trust someone. Make an Opposed [[Attribute#INTUITION INT|Intuition]] + [[Attribute#CHARISMA CHA|Charisma]] Test against the target’s [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]] + [[Attribute#CHARISMA CHA|Charisma]]. This is not an exact science. A successful test doesn’t mean the target will never betray you (intentions have been known to change), and deceptive characters can gain another’s confidence easily. This primarily serves as a benchmark or gut instinct about how much you can trust the person you are dealing with.

##### LIFTING/CARRYING (BOD + STR)
The baseline for lifting weight is 15 kilograms per point of Strength. Anything more than that requires a [[Attribute#STRENGTH STR|Strength]] + [[Attribute#BODY BOD|Body]] Test. Each hit increases the max weight lifted by 15 kilograms. Lifting weight above your head, as with a clean & jerk, is more difficult. The baseline for lifting weight above the head is 5 kilograms per point Strength. Each hit on the Lifting Test increases the maximum weight you can lift by 5 kilograms.

Carrying weight is significantly different than lifting weight. Characters can carry Strength x 10 kilograms in gear without effort. Additional weight requires a Lifting Test. Each hit increases the maximum by 10 kilograms. For more details on carrying gear, see Carrying Gear, p. 420.

##### MEMORY (LOG + WIL) for 
While there are numerous mnemonic devices, and even a few select pieces of bioware, designed for remembering information, memory is not a skill. If a character needs to recall information make a [[Attribute#LOGIC LOG|Logic]] + [[Attribute#WILLPOWER WIL|Willpower]] Test. Use the Knowledge Skill Table to determine the threshold. If a character actively tries to memorize information, make a Logic + Willpower Test at the time of memorization. Each hit adds a dice to the Recall Test later on.

Glitches can have a devastating effect on memory. A glitch means the character misremembers some portion of the information, such as order of numbers in a passcode. A critical glitch means the character has completely fooled himself into believing and thus remem- bering something that never actually happened.
