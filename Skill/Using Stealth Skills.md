[[Skill]]

Skill tests in the Stealth skill group boil down to staying
hidden when someone is trying to find you. Treat
this as an Opposed Test using Perception + Intuition,
and apply any appropriate Perception modifiers (see p.
135). The gamemaster can decide to swap out Perception
for a suitable skill from the Stealth skill group at no
penalty. For example, if a Triad assassin is trying to spot
you in a crowd, she could rely on her own experience
at hiding and roll Sneaking + Intuition. 

Disguise and Impersonation are also handled using
Opposed Tests. When the makeup and costuming are
first applied, the character creating the disguise performs
a Disguise + Intuition [Mental] Test. The numberof hits rolled is the threshold foranyone trying to see through the disguise later on. Impersonation can be used to improve a disguise, or it can stand alone. A character in disguise canroll their Impersonation + Charisma [Social] and add the number of hits to the threshold for breaking the disguise. If Impersonation is being used without the benefit of a disguise (such as when vocally imitating someone), treat itas standard Opposed Test. A Disguise Kit (see Tools, p. 443) can be used to build a Disguise, using the Building & Repairing rules (p. 146). Add half the threshold of the Extended Test used to make the disguise as a dice pool bonus to your Disguise Test, to a maximum bonus of 4.
