[[Skill]]

Talented forgers can simulate anything from a signature
to a credstick to the Mona Lisa. The skill is most often
used for doctoring hardcopy IDs, signatures, and official
paperwork, but it can be used to fabricate anything you
can imagine and your skill level can handle.
Creating a forgery is a Forgery + Logic Test. The limit
for this test is either Physical (for forged art, signatures,
and other physical objects) or Mental (for credsticks,
documents, and other items that are more data than
substance). Your dice pool is adjusted by appropriate
modifiers (see the Build/Repair Table for suggestions),
and given a time requirement by the gamemaster (an
interval from the Extended Test Difficulties table is fine).
The quality of the forgery is based on the number of hits
scored on the test. This number acts as the threshold for
attempts to spot the fake. Anyone examining a forgery
makes an Opposed Test using a Perception + Intuition
[Mental] Test or Forgery + Intuition [Mental] Test. If they
score as many or more hits than the quality of the forgery,
the item is exposed as a fake.
Data-based forgeries, like credsticks, documents,
and SINs, donâ€™t really hold up well to scrutiny, what with
information being so readily available. They can appear
almost identical to the original, but any attempt to get it
to act like the original (transfer nuyen, pass a SIN check,
etc.) reveals the forgery.
