[[Skill]]

From virtual instructors to how-to vids, there are numerous
ways to learn skills. There is no substitute, however,
for a flesh-and-blood instructor. In order to teach someone
a skill, a character must have the skill at Rating 4 or
higher. The teacher can only teach up to their own Instruction
Rating. Teaching is an Instruction + Charisma
[Social] Test. Every hit on the Teaching Test reduces the
time for the student to improve their skill by a day (Character
Advancement, p. 103).

Instruction is also used to teach spells, complex
forms, rituals, and various other techniques. The rules
for using Instruction are a bit different in these cases and
are explained in the appropriate sections of this book.
