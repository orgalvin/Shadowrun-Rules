[[Skill]]

The Running skill allows you to increase the distance
you can cover in a Combat Turn by taking a Sprint Action
(p. 162) in their Action Phase. You make a Running
+ Strength [Physical] Test. Each hit adds 1 or 2 meters to
your distance for that Combat Turn, based on your metatype
(see Movement, p. 161). The gamemaster may apply
modifiers for various types of terrain (rocky, slippery,
and so on) and other conditions. You can run non-stop
for a maximum number of minutes equal to your (Body
+ Running) x 10. Fatigue damage begins to take effect
after this point (see Fatigue Damage, p. 172).
