Perception Tests are for any situation involving basic
senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, or taste) where
you’re looking for something that isn’t obvious. Your
gamemaster might call for you to make one, or you can
call for a Perception Test by taking an Observe in Detail
Simple Action to get a handle on what’s going down
around you. Making the threshold on a Perception +
Intuition [Mental] Test indicates that you’ve noticed
something subtle or important (or both)—net hits determine
how much detail you get. If someone is deliberately
trying to hide from you, they’ll oppose your test
with their own skill (Using Stealth Skills, p. 136).
Perception Tests involving vision (which is most of
them) use the same Visibility and Light modifiers as attacks
do in combat (Environmental Modifiers, p. 173).
Other modifiers are listed on the Perception Test Modifiers
table. If a bunch of people are making a Perception
Test and looking for the same thing, use a Teamwork
Test (p. 49).
