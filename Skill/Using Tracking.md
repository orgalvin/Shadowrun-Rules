Tracking a person or critter requires a Tracking + Intuition
[Mental] Test with a threshold based on the terrain
(decided by the gamemaster using the Success Test
Thresholds table, p. 45). If the target is actively obscuring
their trail, tracking is handled as an Opposed Test.
The tracker rolls Tracking + Intuition [Mental] against
the target’s Sneak + Agility [Physical]. Any net successes
on a Tracking Test can be used to gain additional information
about the trail, such as the number of people
using the trail, type of critters recently using it, and how
old the tracks are. In urban tracking, additional hits can
be used to identify local crowd movement patterns,
relevant cameras, and AR clues that reveal where the
target was heading and how long ago it passed by.
The gamemaster may choose to apply modifiers
for conditions such as weather, age of the tracks, the
amount of people who’ve trampled the trail, and so on.
Individuals using a tracking dog or other tracking critter
may use Animal Handling as a Teamwork Test for their
animal’s Tracking Test.
