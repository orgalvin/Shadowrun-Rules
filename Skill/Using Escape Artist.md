In Shadowrun, you might just find yourself caught instead
of killed. Escape Artist provides a chance to escape
from most forms of confinement, including ropes,
handcuffs, and other bindings. To get out of restraints,
make an Escape Artist + Agility [Physical] Test against
a threshold based on what you’re trying to get out of.
If you succeed, you’re free after working on it for one
minute (20 Combat Turns), divided by the number of
net hits you get on the test. The dice pool is modified
by a variety of factors, such as whether or not you’re
being watched (and trying to be subtle) or if you’re
carrying a set of lockpicks. These situational modifiers
are on the Escape Artist Table. The gamemaster may
decide that some restraints are too difficult to escape
from without outside help.
