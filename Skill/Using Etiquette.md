[[Skill]]

Etiquette is about blending into the social fabric. Skilled
characters can move through a social situation without
anyone realizing that they don’t belong. It’s more than
knowing the right mores (you could look those up on the
Matrix), it’s about trained instinct.

You can use Etiquette to ease suspicions, so that people
might trust you more than they would an outsider.
Make an Etiquette + Charisma [Social] Test against the
other person’s Perception + Charisma [Social] Opposed
Test. If you get any net hits, they’ll accept you. If you get
3 or more net hits, their attitude toward you will improve,
moving up a line on the “NPC’s attitude” section of the
Social Modifiers table.

The skill is not meant to replace role-playing, but it
can save you from a social blunder that you (the player)
make when your character probably wouldn’t have.
When this happens, make an Etiquette Test against a
threshold equal to the severity of the blunder (set by the
gamemaster using the Success Test Thresholds table,
p. 45). A successful test means your character recovers
from the misstep.

When making Etiquette tests with a group of NPCs,
use the same rules for influencing groups (Using Social
Skills, p. 139).

##### GLITCHES
A glitch on an Etiquette Test is treated the same as a
social blunder—the temporary annoyance could give
you a –2 dice modifier on your next social test. Critical
glitches result in major social gaffes that have a lasting
effect on the relationship your character has with
others—the NPC’s stance towards your character could
move one step toward Enemy. This is the stuff of which
long-time grudges and major feuds are made, the
words of disrespect that set street armies into motion.
