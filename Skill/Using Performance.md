Performance is a Simple Test with a Social limit—the
gamemaster can use your hits to gauge the artistry of
your performance. If you’re trying distract a target, or
sweep them up in your performance, the generic modifiers
on the Social Modifiers Table (p. 140) apply, and
your target(s) use their Charisma + Willpower to oppose
your test.
