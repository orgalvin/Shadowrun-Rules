[[Rules]]

Success Tests
`(Skill used in test) + (Attribute used in test)[Applicable limit](threshold) Test`
ex: `Perception+Intuition[Mental](2) Test`

Opposed Tests
`(Skill used in test) + (Attribute used in test)[Applicable limit] Opposed Test`
ex: `Perception+Intuition[Mental] Opposed Test`

Extended Tests
`(Skill used in test) + (Attribute used in test)[Applicable limit](threshold, interval) Extended Test`
ex: `Perception+Intuition[Mental](10, 1 hour) Extended Test`
notes: instead of obtaining all hits in a single roll, roll repeatedly until you reach the threshold or run out of time, are interrupted, or run out of rolls. The interval describes the time taken for each roll. **With each successive roll on the extended test, remove an additional die until there are none left at which point the test is over from the character being exhausted.**

Teamwork Tests
1 runner acts as the leader. All others roll `Skill+Attribute`. 
- For each other that scores at least one hit, the limit for the test increases by one
- For each hit scored by others, the leader adds a die to their pool. This is limited to a number of dice equal to the leaders rating in `Skill`
- If any other critically glitches, the leader receives no assistance at all and suffers a regular glitch.

Retrying Tests
A runner may retry a failed test but runners must take a cumulative -2 penalty on each retry unless they take a sufficient break.
