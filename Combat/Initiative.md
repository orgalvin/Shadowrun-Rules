[[Combat!]] [[Derived Calculations]]
- A player can roll a maximum of 5d6 for a combat turn
- At the end of each initiative pass subtract 10 from all initiative scores. Any actor with an initiative score still greater than 0 can proceed in normal order before the new Combat Turn starts
- Any modifications to initiative are done immediately <pg. 160>

Delaying Actions
- the delayed action must be declared during the [[Combat Turn Sequence]]
- a character must declare that he is intervening at a specific initiative score, but can make that declaration whenever they want. 
- a character can go before, after, or at the same time as a currently acting character who would normally take their action on the same initiative score, but any action that they take receive a -1 dice pool penalty

Timed items
- some items go off after a preset interval, usually the activating character's _current_ initiative score during the next combat turn
- if an item has a timer set by a player, they can select a pre-determined initiative pass or beginning or end of a combat turn
