[[Combat!]]

There are times when a character is permitted to take an action outside his allotted Action Phase. Such rare instances are called Interrupt Actions and are clearly
identified in the rules. When a character uses an Interrupt Action, such as Full Defense, he takes an action out of turn, but only if he has enough Initiative Score left in the Combat Turn to pay the price for the action. Interrupt Actions occur outside the normal course of the Combat Turn and do not cost the character their Action Phase (unless they reduce their Initiative Score below 0 with their actions). The Initiative Score reduction occurs at the time of the Interrupt Action. A character may only take an Interrupt Action prior to their first Action Phase if they are not surprised (see Surprise, p. 192).

## BLOCK
(–5 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character may choose to use her own unarmed combat skill to block incoming melee attacks as an Interrupt Action (see Defending in Combat, p. 188). By decreasing her Initiative Score, the defending character can add her Unarmed Combat skill to their defense test.
This is a one-time add, unlike going on Full Defense (below) which lasts for an entire Combat Turn.

## DODGE
(–5 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character may choose to use her own skill to dodge incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action (see Defending in Combat, p. 188). By decreasing her Initiative Score, the defending character can add her Gymnastics skill to the defense test. This is a one-time add, unlike going on Full Defense (below) which lasts for an entire Combat Turn.

## HIT THE DIRT
(–5 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character who has already used their Free Action may choose to drop prone when caught by suppressive fire using this action (see Suppressive Fire, p. 179). The defending character doesn’t need to make the Reaction + Edge test but is considered prone on their next Action Phase. If the suppressive fire continues, the defending character needs to use a Stand Up Simple Action to get back up, risking getting shot, or fight from the ground. If the suppressive fire has stopped the prone character still needs to use a Stand Up Simple Action to get back up.

## INTERCEPT
(–5 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character may take an Interrupt Action to intercept an opponent who attempts to move past him (within 1 + Reach meter(s)) or break out of melee combat (see Interception, p. 194). The Intercept Action allows a character to make a melee attack out of turn. If the character does not have enough Initiative Score left that Action Phase he cannot intercept.

## PARRY
(–5 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character may choose to use his own melee weapon skill to deflect incoming melee attacks as an Interrupt Action (see Defending in Combat, p. 188). By decreasing his Initiative Score, the defending character can add his melee weapon skill to their defense test. This is a one-time add, unlike going on Full Defense (below), which lasts for an entire Combat Turn. Bonus die, such as die from a relevant weapon foci, can be added to this test.

## FULL DEFENSE
(–10 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character may choose to focus on deliberately avoiding incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action (see Defending in Combat, p. 188). This action adds the character’s Willpower to their Defense tests for the entire Combat Turn. Full Defense actions may be taken at any time, even before the character’s Action Phase as an Interrupt Action, as long as the character is not surprised. Characters may only go on Full Defense if they have enough Initiative Score left in that Combat Turn. The bonus gained in this manner is kept until the end of the Combat Turn so a character can choose to fight defensively early in the round by decreasing her Initiative Score to increase her defense. This bonus is also cumulative with other Interrupt Actions.
