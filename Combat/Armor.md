[[Combat!]]

**Armor**

Armor is used iwth Body to make damage resistance tests (see [[Defend]]). The armor rating is modified by the attack's [[Armor Penetration]] value.

Good armor protects a character from serious physical harm. if the modified [[Damage Value]] of an attack causing Physical damage is less than the AP-modified armor rating, then the attack causes stun damage rather than physical damage.

**Encumbrance**
If a character is wearing more than one piece of [[Armor]], only the highest value of armor applies.

Armor accessories, items listed with a '+' in front of their rating, add to the character's [[Armor]] for the purpose of Damage Resistance tests. The maximum bonus a character receives from these items is limited to their Strength [[Attribute]]. For every 2 points by which the Strength is exceeded, the character suffers a -1 penalty to Agility and Reaction [[Attribute]]

**Armor Penetration**
A weapon's AP modifies the targets [[Armor]] rating on an attack. If the target is not wearing armor, the AP value is ignored. If a weapon's AP reduces an armor's rating to 0 or below, the character loses all his armor dice on the damage resistance test, but does not subtract from the dice pool coming from their Body [[Attribute]]
