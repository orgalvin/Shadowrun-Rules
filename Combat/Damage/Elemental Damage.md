[[Combat!]]

**Acid Damage**
- Physical
- Reduces the rating of any [[Armor]] it hits by 1
- If not removed (spell evaporates into mana after spell is done or washed off), it continues to burn
	- Each Combat Turn the base DV of the acid is reduced by 1 and the damage applied again
	- continues to burn through armor unless base DV is 0.
- Can potentially create smoke effects

**Cold Damage**
- Physical
- Can make armor brittle, liquids freeze, lubricants gum up, etc. Make a simple Armor Test for anything directly hit, if the armor gets no hits, it breaks and provides no armor bonus until [[Repair]]s are made. If a glitch happens, the armor is destroyed irreparably, with a critical glitch it is destroyed irreparably in a dangerous way.

**Electricity Damage**
- Stun or Physical depending on source and/or target. The Non-conductivity [[Armor Upgrade]] adds its full value to the [[Armor]] value.
- Can stun and incapacitate the target (though if no damage, no extra effects either)
- Secondary effect on meat is -1 dice pool penalty on all actions and Defense tests, but not Damage Resistance Tests, for 1 combat turn and an immediate [[Initiative]] reduction of 5. These effects do not accumulate with multiple attacks but the length of the penalty is increased by 1 per successful hit. 
	- If no initiative score is left, the reduction is applied to the next combat turn.
- Electronic Equipment and [[Drones]] suffer damage as Physical instead of Stun. Tehy resist damage as usual and suffer the secondary effect if they take any damage.
	- The secondary effect for electronics and drones is secondary [[Matrix Actions]] damage equal to half of the Physical damage rounded down
	- Vehicles suffer no secondary effects unless through a [[Called Shot]]

**Fire Damage**
- Physical
- To determine if something catches fire, roll Armor Value + Fire Resistance - Fire AP. The threshold is the net hits rolled on the fire-attack. If the item succeeds, it is not on fire. Armor accessories are excluded from the test.
- Whe something catches fire, the fire has an initial damage value of 3. This damage is caused at the end of each combat turn and the DV increases by 1 at the start of each subsequent combat turn until the tiem is destroyed or the fire put out. 
- You can use water or smothering with an Agility + Intuition Test and reducing the fire's DV by 1 for each hit.
