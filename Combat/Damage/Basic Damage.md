[[Combat!]]

Damage is defined as Physical or Stun, with each being tracked on a separate condition monitor

**Physical Damage**
Typically done by guns, explostions, melee weapons, and many spells, weapons that inflict physical damage are marked with the letter 'P'.

The number of boxes in the Physical Condition Monitor is (Body [[Attribute]] / 2) + 8.

**Stun Damage**
Stun damage si stuff like bruising and muscle fatigue. It is typically odne by fists, kicks, blunt weapons, stun rounds, shock weapons, concussion grenades, and some spells. It is marked by the letter 'S'.

The number of boxes in the Stun Condition Monitor is (Willpower [[Attribute]] / 2) + 8

**Wound Modifiers**
Injuries can interfere with different actions. Wound modifiers are accumulated with every third box of damage and are cumulative between physical and stun damage tracks as well as with other negative modifiers such as spells or adverse conditions.

Wound modifiers are applied to all tests not about reducing the number of boxes you are about to take on the Condition Monitor (such as damage resistance, resisting direct combat spells, toxin resistance, etc). The wound modifier penalty is also applied to the character's initiative [[Attribute]] and therefore their [[Initiative]] during combat.

**Exceeding the condition monitor**
- if the damage is Stun, it carries over into the Physical damage track. For every two boxes exceeded, carry over 1 box to the Physical damage track
- if the damage is Physical, the player is killed if the damage accumulates to a number of boxes greater than the character's Body [[Attribute]]. One point over that limit, and the character is dead.
	- If the physical damage overflow has not been filled, the character can survive with prompt treatment. Until they are treated, the character takes additional damage at a rate of 1 box per (Body) minutes.
