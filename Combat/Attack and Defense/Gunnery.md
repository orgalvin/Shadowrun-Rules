- to detect something with sensors, make a sensor test.
	- Characters roll Perception + Intuition[Sensor]
	- Vehicles roll Pilot + Clearsight[Sensor]
	- if the target is trying to evade, it is an opposed test vs Infiltration + Agility[Physical] for humanoids or Infiltration (vehicle) + Reaction[Handling] for driven vehicles or Pilot + [Model] Stealth[Handling] for drones.
	- Dice applied for infiltration cannot exceed the driver's Vehicle [[Skill]]

- Sensor Targeting
	- Passive Targeting - vehicle's Sensor attribute substitutes for the Accuracy of the weapon. Attacker rolls Gunnery + Logic[Sensor]. The target's Signature modifiers are also applied as a dice pool modifier
	- Active Targeting - make a sensor test with a simple action, the net hits are applied as a negative modifier to the defense test. Once locked on additional active targeting can be used without additional sensor tests. The targt can use the Evade Detection action to break the lock.
