### Firing Modes
![[Firing Mode Table.png]]
#### Single Shot (Simple)
Firing a Single Shot (SS) weapon uses a Simple Action that cannot be combined with any other attacking Simple Action in the same Action Phase. SS weapons can take advantage of the Multiple Attacks Free Action if the attacker is wielding two such weapons. Single Shot weapons include bolt-action rifles, single-action revolvers, pump-action shotguns, lever-action rifles, and some large weapons that need extra time to chamber a fresh round due to the cartridge’s size.

Single Shot fire assumes another round is readied with each shot as long as rounds are available in the gun.

#### Semi-Automatic (Simple)
Semi-automatic weapons fire a round every time the trigger is pulled and automatically chamber a fresh round after each shot. Semi-Automatic weapons fire a single round with a Simple Action but cannot combine that with any other attack Action in the same Action Phase. Semi-automatic weapons can take advantage of the Multiple Attacks Free Action if the shooter has two semi-automatic weapons. They also have the option of using a [[#Semi-Automatic Burst Complex]].

#### Semi-Automatic Burst (Complex)
Semi-Automatic Burst mode is three semi-automatic shots taken in quick succession. Semi-Automatic weapons can fire a burst of three rounds with a Complex Action. With more shots going downrange they increase the chance that a bullet will hit. Semi-Automatic bursts can take advantage of the Multiple Attacks Free Action to fire at multiple targets with the same burst.

#### Burst Fire (Simple)
Burst Fire (BF) weapons are usually SMGs or assault rifles, but some pistols and shotguns can be modified for this mode. In burst-fire mode a gun rapidly fires three bullets every time the trigger is pulled. Firing a weapon in Burst Fire mode is a Simple Action that cannot be combined with any other attack Simple Action in the same Action Phase. Burst Fire weapons can take advantage of the Multiple Attacks Free Action to fire at multiple targets with the same burst.

#### Long Burst (Complex)
Long Burst (LB) mode is really just quickly firing in Burst Fire mode. In this mode, a gun fires two three-round bursts in rapid succession. Firing a weapon in Long Burst mode is a Complex Action. Long Burst weapons can take advantage of the Multiple Attacks Free Action to fire at multiple targets with the same burst.

#### Full-Auto (Simple/Complex)
Weapons that can fire in Full-Auto (FA) mode can throw bullets for as long as the attacker keeps the trigger pulled and the rounds last. Full-Auto weapons can be fired as a Simple Action, firing 6 bullets, or a Complex Action, firing 10 bullets. Full-auto weapons can take ad- vantage of the Multiple Attacks Free Action to fire at multiple targets with the same burst.

#### Suppressive Fire (Complex)
Suppressive fire takes a Complex Action, uses twenty rounds of ammo, and ignores recoil. Though it may appear as a “spray and pray” technique it is in fact a combination of controlled and fully automatic bursts focused over a narrow area and directed at anything that moves. A character can suppress a triangular area projecting from the shooting character outward up to a distance of his choosing, up to the maximum range of the weapon, with a width of 10 meters at its end and a height of 2 meters. Make a (Weapon Skill) + [[Attribute#AGILITY AGI|Agility]] [Accuracy] Test, including bonuses for smartlink, laser sight, tracer rounds, and other gamemaster-approved modifiers, and record the hits. The suppressive fire zone lasts until the end of the Combat Turn as long as the firer does not move or commit to any other action.

Anyone in the suppressive fire zone or immediately adjacent to it takes a dice pool penalty to all actions equal to the shooter’s hits, unless they are completely unaware of it (a magician using astral projection, for example).

Any character who is in the suppressed area (but not behind cover or prone), or who moves into or out of the area before the end of the suppressive fire, risks catching some flying lead. That character must make a [[Attribute#REACTION REA|Reaction]] + [[Attribute#EDGE EDG|Edge]] Test (+ any dice they may get as a result of choosing to use Full Defense) with a threshold equal to the hits scored by the suppressing attacker. Note that in the test, you use your full Edge rating, regardless of whether you have spent points during the session (though you do not, of course, use burned Edge points). If the test fails, the character is hit, suffering damage equal to the weapon’s base Damage Value modified by any special ammunition being fired. Characters in the suppressed area who remain behind full cover or drop prone are not at risk (though they suffer the normal modifiers for being prone; see Melee Modifiers, p. 187, and Ranged Modifiers, p. 173). Characters may choose to avoid rolling and use their Free Action to go prone and avoid getting hit. If a character does not have a Free Action remaining she may use the Hit the Dirt Interrupt Action and go prone instead of getting hit. Any character who stands up or moves again before the suppressive fire stops must make a test to see if she is hit.

If multiple suppressive fire actions occur covering the same area, only the highest dice pool penalty counts against targets in or near the suppressed area, but targets must make a [[Attribute#REACTION REA|Reaction]] + [[Attribute#EDGE EDG|Edge]] test against all overlapping zones, taking damage from the ones missed. Reaction + Edge Tests in this situation are subject to the diminishing pool effect of being shot by multiple attackers in a single Action Phase. After each roll apply a –1 die penalty to the defender’s dice pool.

### Shotguns
Shotguns described in the Street Gear section (p. 429) fire slug rounds. Characters can load them with shot rounds, but shot rounds have little effect against 21st-century body armor. To determine the damage done by shot rounds, apply the flechette ammunition rules to the Damage Value indicated for the weapon.

Shot rounds spread when fired, creating a cone of shot extending outward from the shotgun’s muzzle. This allows the shot to hit multiple targets, but with reduced effectiveness due to the spread of the shot pellets over a wider area. The mechanism that controls this spread is called the choke.

The shotgun user can set his weapon’s choke for a narrow spread, medium spread, or wide spread. Changing the choke setting requires a Simple Action (or a Free Action if the shotgun is smartlinked).

#### Narrow Spread
The target gets –1 dice pool modifier for defense at all ranges.

#### Medium Spread
At short range, you get –1 DV, targets get –3 defense, and up to two targets within a 2-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. At medium range, you get –3 DV, targets get –3 defense, and up to three targets within a 4-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. At long range, you get –5 DV, –1 Accuracy, targets get –3 defense, and up to four targets within a 6-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. At extreme range, you get –7 DV, –1 Accuracy, targets get –3 de- fense, and up to six targets within a 8-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. Medium spreads cannot be used with Called Shots.

#### Wide Spread
At short range, you get –3 DV, targets get –5 defense, and up to two targets within a 3-meter spread can be tar- geted using the same roll. At medium range, you get –5 DV, targets get –5 defense, and up to three targets within a 6-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. At long range, you get –7 DV, –1 Accuracy, targets get –5 defense, and up to four targets within a 9-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. At extreme range, you get –9 DV, –1 Accuracy, targets get –5 defense, and up to six targets within a 12-meter spread can be targeted using the same roll. Wide spreads cannot be used with Called Shots.
