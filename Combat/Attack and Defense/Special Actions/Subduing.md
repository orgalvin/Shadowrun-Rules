[[Special Actions]]

Subduing
- resolve melee combat normally using the unarmed combat skill. If the attacker hits, compare Strength + net hits to the defenders Physical limit. If exceeded, the attacker grapples and immobilized the defender, doing no damage.
- To break out, the defender does a Complex action and must succeed on an Unarmed combat + strength [Physical] test with a threshold equal to the net hits of the attackers original grapple check. 
- Subdued character is considered prone
- Grappler must use a complex action on each of their action phases to hold the grapple, but may also do one of the following:
	- make an additional unarmed combat attack test +2 to secure their grip, adding or subtracting net hits to their original grapple check value
	- inflict stun damage equal to strength. Armor applies
	- knock defender down using called shot ruels. The attacker gets the superior posiition bonus (+2)
