[[Special Actions]]

All shots incur -4 dice penalty pool and cost a free action in addition to the basic attack action

Blast out of Hands

- opponent takes a -4 dice pool modifier on next action if even a single net hit

Harder Knock
- stun damage -> physical damage

Knock Down (Melee Only)
- [[Knockdown]]
- on glitch, both fall down
- on critical glitch, attacker falls down and defender remains standing

Shake up
- target loses 5 from initiative score as frightened by shots as long as any hits

Splitting the damage
- splits damage between stun and physical
- target must be wearing armor and attacker's AP must be less than that armor, you cannot stun someone with bullets if their armor can't resist it
- If damage was an odd number, stun track takes more. If damage value is less than armor value of the defense, the attack does only half damage, all to the stun track

Trick Shot
- attacker gains bonus on intimidation rolls after the shot

Vitals
- increase damage (+2 dv) by targeting vital areas
