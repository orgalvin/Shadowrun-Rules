[[Attack And Defense]]

**Grenades**
When throwing a grenade, choose a location as a tar- get. Use a Throw Weapon Simple Action and make a Throwing Weapons + Agility [Physical] (3) Test modified for range and all the usual conditions. Success means the grenade lands right where you wanted. If you don’t meet the threshold, the grenade scatters. The gamemaster determines scatter by consulting the [[Scatter Table]] (p. 182). Three hits on the test means no scatter, but it is still possible to hit the target if the scatter roll is low and the thrower got some hits (see Determine Scatter, p. 182). This all goes back to the old saying: “Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.”

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive or gas- delivery packages. They may come with a built-in timer to detonate after a pre-set amount of time (usually three seconds), a motion-sensor set to detonate on impact, or a wireless link set to detonate upon remote command. The type of detonation device determines the special rules and timing of grenade explosions.

Built-in Timer: This detonation method uses the at- tacker’s Initiative Score as the determining factor for det- onation. The grenade is thrown during the character’s Ac- tion Phase and detonates in the next Combat Turn on the Initiative Score in which it was thrown minus 10, regardless of any additional changes to the thrower’s Initiative Score.

Motion Sensor: Grenades using a motion sensor are extremely dangerous. Once armed (about a second af- ter the sensor is activated) the grenade explodes after any sudden stop or change in direction, meaning hitting the wall, floor, or target. This method uses the standard Ranged Attack rules but adds an extra step if it misses the target (no net hits on the attack roll).

After a failed attack roll, the thrower must roll for scatter and the grenade scatters the full amount before exploding immediately. A glitch on the attack roll means the grenade does not detonate on initial impact but in- stead doubles the scatter distance and explodes. A Crit- ical Glitch means the thrower waited too long, and the throw sets off the grenade. The grenade detonates im- mediately, affecting the attacker and those around him. (Warned you it was dangerous.)

Wireless Link: This is the safest way to throw a gre- nade in some aspects, but it also comes with some risk and effort. The thrower (or anyone else who has a mark on the grenade) can detonate it by a wireless link. This re- quires the attacker to have a direct neural interface to the linked device and use the Change Wireless Device Mode Free Action. This method also reduces scatter. Without a DNI the attacker must use the Change Linked Device Mode Simple Action in their next or any of their subse- quent Action Phases to detonate the grenade and scatter is not reduced

**Launchers**
Occasionally, characters get their hands on mili- tary-grade hardware, like grenade launchers, missiles, and rocket launchers. Resolving a launched grenade, rocket, or missile attack is a two-step process. The first step determines where the projectile ends up in rela- tion to the target (see Determine Scatter, p. 182). The second step resolves the effect of the projectile’s ex- plosion (see Blast Effects, p. 182).

When you fire a grenade, rocket, or missile you use a Fire Weapon Simple Action and roll a Heavy Weapons + Agility [Accuracy] (3) Test modified for range and all the usual conditions. Success means the launched weapon hits right where you wanted. If you don’t meet the threshold, use the [[Scatter Table]]

**Confined space explosions**
 When a grenade detonates in a confined space, such as a hallway or room, the gamemaster must first determine whether any barriers (usually walls) stood firm against the explosion. Consult the Destroying Barriers rules (p. 197). If the walls or doors hold up, the blast is channeled. Otherwise, determine blast effects normally.

If the walls hold, the shock wave reflects off of them, continuing back in the direction from which it came. If this rebounding shock wave maintains enough Dam- age Value to reach a character, that character is subject to the appropriate blast effect. If the character is struck a second time by the shock wave (once as it headed out and again as it rebounded), the Damage Value of the blast is equal to the combined Damage Value of the two waves.

Theoretically, a detonating explosive’s blast could re- bound repeatedly off each of the six surfaces in a small, well-built room, raising the effective Damage Value of the blast to a value far higher than the original damage of the grenade. This is known as the “chunky salsa effect.”

**Multiple simultaneous explosions**
When multiple explosives detonate at once the effects are similar to those of a blast in a confined space (more chunky salsa). When two explosions occur on the same Combat Initiative Score and both blasts effect the same character add half the value of the lower DVs to the highest DV and apply it all as a single modified Damage Value for the purposes of Damage Resistance tests. For AP calculations, use the best AP and improve it by 1 for every additional explosion.
