[[Combat!]]

Step 1: Declare
- attacker declares an attack as part of the action phase
- defender declares what method is being used to defend. 
	- A standard defence (Reaction + Intuition [[Attribute]]s) is free.
	- For a price the defender can instead choose to Dodge, Parry, Block, or go on Full Defense

Step 2: Attack
- Attacker rolls Combat Skill + Attribute +/- modifiers [Limit]
	- Apply wound, environmental, recoil, and situational modifiers to the attacker according to the specific attack

Step 3: Defend
- Defend 1/2: Defender rolls Reaction + Intuition +/- Modifiers
	- Apply wound, environmental, and situational modifiers according to the specific attack
	- If the attacker scores more hits than the defender, the attack hits the target. Note the net hits and move on to 2/2. If the hits are tied, the attack is considered a grazing hit, doing no damage but allowing certain contact-only attacks (poisons, shock gloves, touch only spells) to still apply their effects/damage.
- Defend 2/2: Add the attackers net hits to the damage value of the weapon to determine the modified damage value. Apply any AP modifier to the defender's armor to determine if the damage is Physical or Stun (if modified DV is less than the modified AV)
	- If the modified armor value is positive, defender rolls Body + modified Armor to resist damage, otherwise the defneder only rolls Body. Each hit scored reduces the modified DV by 1

Step 4: Apply Effect
- Apply the remaining damage to the appropriate condition monitor. Check for Wound Modifiers, knockdown, and any additional effects based on damage type.
