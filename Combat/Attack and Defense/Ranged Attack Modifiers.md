**Recoil**
(Strength / 3 (rounded up) + 1 + recoil compensation of any guns being shot) minus the number of bullets being fired this round. If this is negative, that is the modifier.
- This accumulates every action phase and combat turn unless the character takes a simple or complex action other than shooting.
- Single shot weapons do not experience recoil unless performing the Multiple Attacks action
- Mounted weapons have recoil compensation equal to the Body of the vehicle plus any built in recoil compensation of the weapon

**Misc**

- if trying to break off of the melee, they risk and intercept action and a swing as well as risking not getting out of melee if they are tagged
- Called shots also require a free action to perform

- if there are insufficient bullets the character can still take the action but at a -1 for each bullet short. Suppression area also decreases
- Suppressive fire supresses an area 10 meters wide at its end and a height of 2 meters, up to as far as the gun can shoot
	- weapon skill + agility [Accuracy] test including normal bonuses, and record the hits.
	- zone lasts until end of combat turn so long as the firer doesn't change their action
	- anyone in the zone or immediately adjacent to it takes a dice pool penalty to all actions equal to the shooter's hits, as long as they are aware of the gunfire
	- anyone who is in the area or moves into or out of it, who is not behind full cover or prone, before the end must make a Reaction + Edge test (+ any dice for full defense) with a threshold equal to the hits. Use full edge rating unless there are any burned edge. If test is failed take weapon's base damage value modified by any special ammunition being fired.
	- Suppressive fire does not stack with other suppresive fire, only the highest dice pool counts.
