[[Combat!]]

Metatype | Walk Rate | Run Rate | Sprint Increase
---------|-----------|----------|-----------------
Dwarf, Troll | Agility x 2 | Agility x 4 | +1m/hit
Elf, Human, Ork | Agility x 2 | Agility x 4 | +2m/hit

Getting from one place to another, especially from one
piece of cover to another or closing the distance on an opponent,
is important. Characters in Shadowrun have three
types of movement: Walking, Running, and Sprinting.
A character’s movement for an entire Combat Turn
(meaning total movement for all Initiative Passes, not
for each Initiative Pass) is based on their Run rate, which
is determined by metatype. Walk rate determines the
farthest a character can move during a Combat Turn before
they are considered to be Running.
It’s important to point out that “run” does not mean
bolt as fast as you can; that’s sprinting. Think of running as
a trained combat hustle or a jog, something to get you to
another point quickly but still leave you able to perform
other actions, albeit with a penalty. Sprinting is exactly
that, running as fast as you can from point A to point B.

Sprinting
Characters may attempt to increase their
running distance by performing a Sprint Action
during their Action Phase. In this action,
they make a Running + Strength [Physical]
Test. Each hit increases the distance a character
can move in a Combat Turn by either 1
meter (for dwarfs and trolls) or 2 meters (for
elves, humans, and orks). Characters are allowed
a maximum number of Sprinting tests
equal to half their Running skill per Combat Turn, minimum
of 1. Sprinting characters also suffer fatigue (see
Fatigue from Running, p. 172) if they sprint for too long

Characters who are running take a –2 dice pool modifier
to all actions performed while running (except for
Sprinting). Characters charging into melee combat gain
a +4 dice pool modifier (making a net bonus of +2
when combined with the general penalty) when running
into melee combat. Characters making a ranged attack
against a running opponent suffer a –2 dice pool penalty to their attack test. Characters making a ranged attack
against a sprinting opponent suffer a –4 dice pool modifier
to their attack test.
