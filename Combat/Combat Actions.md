### Free Actions
#### Call Shot
![[Called Shot]]

#### Change Linked Device Mode
A character may use a Free Action to activate, deactivate, or switch the mode on any device that he is linked to by a direct neural interface through either a wired or wireless link. This includes activating cyberware, changing a smartgun’s firing mode, changing a smartlinked shotgun’s choke, deactivating thermographic vision, switching a commlink to hidden mode, turning a device’s wireless functionality off, and so on. Note that it takes longer to interact with some devices, as noted in individual gear descriptions.

### Simple Actions
#### Activate Focus
#### Call Spirit
#### Change Device Mode
A character may use a Simple Action to activate, deac- tivate, or change the mode on any device with a simple switch, a virtual button, or a command from a commlink or other control device through either a wired or wireless link. This includes changing a gun’s firing mode, changing a shotgun’s choke, changing vision systems, switching a commlink to hidden mode, turning a device’s wireless functionality off, and so on. It takes longer to interact with some devices; check individual gear descriptions.

Changing mode on a linked smartgun is a free action.

#### Command Spirit(s)
#### Dismiss Spirit
#### Fire Bow
#### Fire Weapon (SA, SS, BF, FA)

#### Insert Clip
#### Observe In Detail
#### Picking Up/Putting Down Object
#### Quick Draw
A character may attempt to quick-draw a pistol, pistol-sized weapon, or small throwing weapon and immediately fire it by using a Quick Draw Simple Action. For the character to successfully draw the weapon, the player must make a (Weapon Skill) + Reaction [Physi- cal] (3) Test. If the weapon is held in a quick-draw holster (see p. 432), reduce the threshold to 2. If the test is successful, the character draws the weapon and fires as a single Simple Action. If the test fails, he clears the gun but cannot fire with the same action. If he glitches, the gun is stuck in the holster or dropped, and no more actions are allowed. On a critical glitch, a drawn blade may be fumbled out of the character’s reach or a pistol accidentally fired while still in the holster; the gamemaster decides the exact nature of the screw-up.

Only properly holstered weapons can be quick- drawn. They do not have to be in a quick-draw holster, but they do need to be in a holster or sheath or on a proper sling to be quick-drawn. Two weapons may be quick-drawn and fired simultaneously, but the (Weapon Skill) + Reaction dice pool is split, and off-hand penalties apply.

#### Ready/Draw Weapon
#### Reckless Spellcasting
[[Magic#Spellcasting]]

#### Reload Weapon (see table)
#### Remove Clip
#### Shift Perception
Shift perception to or from Astral Space

#### Take Aim
A character may take aim with a ready firearm, bow, or throwing weapon as a Simple Action. Take Aim actions are cumulative, but the benefits are lost if the character takes any other kind of action—including a Free Action— at any time before attacking. Take Aim actions may be extended over multiple Action Phases and Combat Turns. The maximum bonus a character may gain from sequential Take Aim actions, either to her limit or her dice pool, is equal to one-half the character’s Willpower, rounded up.

Each Take Aim action applies a +1 dice pool modifier or +1 Accuracy increase to the Attack Test.

If the character is using image magnification or a targeting scope, Take Aim must be used to line up the shot in order to receive the bonus from the item. In this case the first action of Take Aim does not provide any additional bonus beyond enabling the function of the modification.

#### Take Cover
+2, +4 on defense test for partial/full cover

#### Throw Weapon
#### Use Simple Device

### Interrupt Actions
#### Block
(–5 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character may choose to use her own unarmed combat skill to block incoming melee attacks as an Interrupt Action (see Defending in Combat, p. 188). By decreasing her Initiative Score, the defending character can add her Unarmed Combat skill to their defense test.
This is a one-time add, unlike going on Full Defense (below) which lasts for an entire Combat Turn.

#### Dodge
(–5 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character may choose to use her own skill to dodge incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action (see Defending in Combat, p. 188). By decreasing her Initiative Score, the defending character can add her Gymnastics skill to the defense test. This is a one-time add, unlike going on Full Defense (below) which lasts for an entire Combat Turn.

#### Hit the Dirt
(–5 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character who has already used their Free Action may choose to drop prone when caught by suppressive fire using this action (see Suppressive Fire, p. 179). The defending character doesn’t need to make the Reaction + Edge test but is considered prone on their next Action Phase. If the suppressive fire continues, the defending character needs to use a Stand Up Simple Action to get back up, risking getting shot, or fight from the ground. If the suppressive fire has stopped the prone character still needs to use a Stand Up Simple Action to get back up.

#### Intercept
(–5 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character may take an Interrupt Action to intercept an opponent who attempts to move past him (within 1 + Reach meter(s)) or break out of melee combat (see Interception, p. 194). The Intercept Action allows a character to make a melee attack out of turn. If the character does not have enough Initiative Score left that Action Phase he cannot intercept.

#### Parry
(–5 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character may choose to use his own melee weapon skill to deflect incoming melee attacks as an Interrupt Action (see Defending in Combat, p. 188). By decreasing his Initiative Score, the defending character can add his melee weapon skill to their defense test. This is a one-time add, unlike going on Full Defense (below), which lasts for an entire Combat Turn. Bonus die, such as die from a relevant weapon foci, can be added to this test.

#### Full Defense
(–10 INITIATIVE SCORE)
A character may choose to focus on deliberately avoiding incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action (see Defending in Combat, p. 188). This action adds the character’s Willpower to their Defense tests for the entire Combat Turn. Full Defense actions may be taken at any time, even before the character’s Action Phase as an Interrupt Action, as long as the character is not surprised. Characters may only go on Full Defense if they have enough Initiative Score left in that Combat Turn. The bonus gained in this manner is kept until the end of the Combat Turn so a character can choose to fight defensively early in the round by decreasing her Initiative Score to increase her defense. This bonus is also cumulative with other Interrupt Actions.
