The Loyalty Rating is applied as bonus dice whenever a PC negotiates with the contact (or vice-versa). The gamemaster should also use it as a modifier or a threshold (as appropriate) when someone else tries to put the squeeze on a contact about the runners.

### Using Contacts
#### Legwork
Discovering or following up on clues
- To find out if the contact already knows the answer, make a skill test using a relevant [[Skill#Knowledge Skills|Knowledge Skill]] + attribute[Character's Social] to determine if they know something.
	- If they know something, it is up to the gm to determine if they will share the information, and may involve a [[Skill#NEGOTIATION CHARISMA|Negotiation]] test using the Loyalty of the contact as bonus dice. Street Cred can also affect this social limit for this test. For each 100 x (7-Loyalty) nuyen spent, get an extra die
	- If the Contact doesn't nknow anyhting, they can make an Extended Connection + [[Attribute#CHARISMA CHA|Charisma]][Social] test, with an interval of 1 hour. Can also use knowledge and modifiers as appropriate
#### Networking
